Welcome to this lecture note, where we unravel the magic of elliptic curves (EC) without getting lost in the mathematical jungle. Think of this as a cryptographer's guide to EC—a clear, simple, and (dare I say) fun way to grasp the essentials. No need to sweat over heavy computations; we’re keeping it chill and focused on what really matters. Here's what we’re diving into:

# Introduction to Elliptic Curves

## Why Elliptic Curves?
Elliptic curves are fascinating geometric objects, living in the mathematical realm of projective planes. They are essentially a collection of points satisfying specific equations, but their real magic lies in their structure. In the world of cryptography, they shine because, over fields with positive characteristics, elliptic curves form finite, cyclic groups—a critical property for secure systems. What's even cooler? The Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP), a cornerstone of cryptographic security, is believed to be hard on these curves when the field characteristic is sufficiently large.

A special breed of these curves, known as pairing-friendly curves, comes with additional cryptographic superpowers, enabling group pairings with unique advantages. These curves have proven invaluable in cutting-edge applications like SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge). Throughout this chapter, we’ll delve into elliptic curves, focusing on their pairing-based use in SNARKs, all while leaning on the mathematical groundwork laid in earlier sections.


# The Short Weierstrass Form
Alright, let’s make this fun and easy to digest!


### **Affine Short Weierstrass Form – A Simple Introduction**

Imagine a magical land where math meets geometry, and the rulers are the mighty **elliptic curves**. These rulers govern the kingdom using an equation as their law:

$$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b $$

But here’s the catch: their rule only works as long as $4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0$. If this condition isn’t met, the curve collapses into chaos (with things like cusps and self-intersections)!


### **What’s an Elliptic Curve Anyway?**

At its heart, an **elliptic curve** is just a fancy name for a set of points $(x, y)$ that follow the magical law above. Imagine drawing a wiggly loop on paper (or on a graph). For example:

- If $a = -2$ and $b = 1$, the equation becomes:
  $$
  y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 1
  $$
  Over a smooth, continuous field (like the rational numbers, $Q$), this curve would look like a beautiful, wavy figure-eight-ish shape.

- But here’s where the magic gets funky: If you restrict $x$ and $y$ to a **finite field**, like $F_5$ (where all calculations are done modulo 5), the curve doesn’t look like a smooth line anymore. Instead, it’s a scattered collection of points. Imagine tossing blue confetti on a graph—those are your points on the curve!


### **The Point at Infinity – The Curve’s Superhero**

Elliptic curves have a special “missing point” to make them whole. This is called the **point at infinity**, denoted as $O$. It doesn’t live on the regular plane but acts as the **identity element** for addition (like 0 in regular arithmetic). Think of it as the curve’s “reset button”—it makes the math work behind the scenes.


### **Example Time!**

Let’s make an elliptic curve over the finite field $F_5$ (numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, with arithmetic modulo 5). Take the equation:
$$y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 \ \ (\text{mod } 5)$$

Here’s how it works:
1. Plug in all possible $x$-values ($0, 1, 2, 3, 4$).
2. Compute $x^3 + x + 1$, modulo 5.
3. Find all $y^2$-values that match this result.

Let’s try it:
- If $x = 0$: $y^2 = 0^3 + 0 + 1 = 1$, so $y = 1$ or $y = 4$ (since $1^2 = 1$ and $4^2 = 1$ mod 5).
- If $x = 2$: $y^2 = 2^3 + 2 + 1 = 11 \mod 5 = 1$, so $y = 1$ or $y = 4$.

After going through all $x$-values, we get:
$$E_{1,1}(F_5) = \{ O, (0,1), (0,4), (2,1), (2,4), \dots \}$$

It’s just a collection of points (plus the point at infinity), and that’s your elliptic curve over $F_5$ !


### **Geometric Intuition**

If you graph this curve over $\mathbf{Q}$ (rational numbers), it looks smooth and continuous. But over finite fields, it’s like a starry night—dots scattered across the plane. Both are beautiful in their own ways.


### **Why Should I Care?**

This simple equation is the backbone of modern cryptography! The "curve points" are like a secret codebook, and their mathematical structure (like addition and scalar multiplication) makes elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) both secure and efficient.


So there you have it—elliptic curves in the affine form! It’s like building a kingdom of points with rules so magical, they protect your secrets in the digital world.
