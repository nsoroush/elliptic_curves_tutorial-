# Introduction to Elliptic Curves

## Why Elliptic Curves?
Elliptic curves are fascinating geometric objects, living in the mathematical realm of projective planes. They are essentially a collection of points satisfying specific equations, but their real magic lies in their structure. In the world of cryptography, they shine because, over fields with positive characteristics, elliptic curves form finite, cyclic groups—a critical property for secure systems. What's even cooler? The Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP), a cornerstone of cryptographic security, is believed to be hard on these curves when the field characteristic is sufficiently large.

A special breed of these curves, known as pairing-friendly curves, comes with additional cryptographic superpowers, enabling group pairings with unique advantages. These curves have proven invaluable in cutting-edge applications like SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge). Throughout this chapter, we’ll delve into elliptic curves, focusing on their pairing-based use in SNARKs, all while leaning on the mathematical groundwork laid in earlier sections.


# The Short Weierstrass Form
Alright, let’s make this fun and easy to digest!


### **Affine Short Weierstrass Form – A Simple Introduction**

Imagine a magical land where math meets geometry, and the rulers are the mighty **elliptic curves**. These rulers govern the kingdom using an equation as their law:

$$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b $$

But here’s the catch: their rule only works as long as $4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0$. If this condition isn’t met, the curve collapses into chaos (with things like cusps and self-intersections)!


### **What’s an Elliptic Curve Anyway?**

At its heart, an **elliptic curve** is just a fancy name for a set of points $(x, y)$ that follow the magical law above. Imagine drawing a wiggly loop on paper (or on a graph). For example:

- If $a = -2$ and $b = 1$, the equation becomes:
  $$
  y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 1
  $$
  Over a smooth, continuous field (like the rational numbers, $Q$), this curve would look like a beautiful, wavy figure-eight-ish shape.

- But here’s where the magic gets funky: If you restrict $x$ and $y$ to a **finite field**, like $F_5$ (where all calculations are done modulo 5), the curve doesn’t look like a smooth line anymore. Instead, it’s a scattered collection of points. Imagine tossing blue confetti on a graph—those are your points on the curve!


### **The Point at Infinity – The Curve’s Superhero**

Elliptic curves have a special “missing point” to make them whole. This is called the **point at infinity**, denoted as $O$. It doesn’t live on the regular plane but acts as the **identity element** for addition (like 0 in regular arithmetic). Think of it as the curve’s “reset button”—it makes the math work behind the scenes.


### **Example Time!**

Let’s make an elliptic curve over the finite field $F_5$ (numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, with arithmetic modulo 5). Take the equation:
$$y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 \ \ (\text{mod } 5)$$

Here’s how it works:
1. Plug in all possible $x$-values ($0, 1, 2, 3, 4$).
2. Compute $x^3 + x + 1$, modulo 5.
3. Find all $y^2$-values that match this result.

Let’s try it:
- If $x = 0$: $y^2 = 0^3 + 0 + 1 = 1$, so $y = 1$ or $y = 4$ (since $1^2 = 1$ and $4^2 = 1$ mod 5).
- If $x = 2$: $y^2 = 2^3 + 2 + 1 = 11 \mod 5 = 1$, so $y = 1$ or $y = 4$.

After going through all $x$-values, we get:
$$E_{1,1}(F_5) = \{ O, (0,1), (0,4), (2,1), (2,4), \dots \}$$

It’s just a collection of points (plus the point at infinity), and that’s your elliptic curve over $F_5$ !


### **Geometric Intuition**

If you graph this curve over $\mathbf{Q}$ (rational numbers), it looks smooth and continuous. But over finite fields, it’s like a starry night—dots scattered across the plane. Both are beautiful in their own ways.

### **Why Should I Care?**

This simple equation is the backbone of modern cryptography! The "curve points" are like a secret codebook, and their mathematical structure (like addition and scalar multiplication) makes elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) both secure and efficient.


So there you have it—elliptic curves in the affine form! It’s like building a kingdom of points with rules so magical, they protect your secrets in the digital world.

This part of the text highlights the differences in how elliptic curves look depending on the field over which they are defined. Let me simplify and explain it in a fun way:

---

### **Elliptic Curves: Two Worlds, Same Equation**

Imagine you’ve got the same magical equation for an elliptic curve:
$$
y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 1
$$
But depending on the “world” you’re in—whether it’s the rational numbers ($Q$) or a prime field like $F_{9973}$—this curve looks completely different!

---

### **World 1: Rational Numbers ($Q$)**
In the land of rational numbers, every $x$ and $y$ can be fractions or integers, and the curve looks like a smooth, flowing wave. It’s the kind of shape you’d expect from the word “curve.” (Check out the left graph in the image!)

---

### **World 2: Finite Field ($F_{9973}$)**
Now step into the land of finite fields, like $F_{9973}$, where everything is done modulo 9973. Here:
- $x$ and $y$ can only take integer values between 0 and 9972.
- The curve isn’t a smooth wave anymore. Instead, it’s a scattered collection of points (as shown on the right). Every blue dot represents a solution to the equation.

It’s like the curve got turned into a starry sky with discrete points instead of a smooth line. This is because finite fields don’t have the same “continuous” nature as rational numbers.

---

### **Why Does This Happen?**
It all boils down to how numbers behave in these fields:
- In $Q$, there’s an infinite number of points to connect, so the curve feels smooth.
- In $F_{9973}$, there’s only a finite number of possible \((x, y)\) pairs, so the curve looks more like a scatterplot.

---

### **Why Care About $4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0$?**
This condition ensures the curve is **non-singular**, meaning it doesn’t have any weird kinks (cusps) or points where it intersects itself. Without this, the “curve’s law” (group operations) would break, and math wizards (cryptographers) wouldn’t be able to use it properly.

---

### **Takeaway**
Elliptic curves can live in two different worlds—smooth and infinite, or discrete and finite. Both are beautiful, but cryptographers love the second world (finite fields) because it’s secure and computationally efficient. The scattered points may not look like a curve, but they carry all the magic of elliptic curve math!

### **What Does "Elliptic Curve Cryptography in a Circuit" Mean?**

When developing **SNARKs** (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge), we often need to perform **elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)** inside what is known as a **circuit**. Here's what this means step by step:

1. **What is a Circuit?**  
   A circuit is a structured representation of a computation. Think of it like a flowchart or a set of connected logic gates in digital electronics, but for mathematical operations. In cryptographic contexts:
   - A circuit consists of a series of gates performing operations like addition, multiplication, etc.
   - The goal is to represent a complex computation (e.g., elliptic curve point addition) as a sequence of simpler steps that can be efficiently verified.

2. **Why Use ECC in a Circuit?**  
   SNARKs are used to prove that a computation is correct without revealing its details. If the computation involves cryptographic operations, like ECC (used for digital signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, etc.), then these operations must also be represented in the circuit.

3. **SNARK-Friendly Implementation**:  
   ECC needs to be implemented in a **SNARK-friendly way**. This means:
   - The elliptic curve operations (like point addition or scalar multiplication) are broken down into simple arithmetic operations.
   - These operations are then arranged into a circuit that minimizes complexity (e.g., number of gates) and maximizes efficiency.

4. **Example**:  
   Suppose you're verifying a digital signature that uses ECC as part of a larger SNARK proof. To do this:
   - The elliptic curve equations (e.g., $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$) are transformed into arithmetic circuits.
   - Operations like adding two points on the curve or performing scalar multiplication are translated into sequences of additions, multiplications, and inverses, all within the finite field.

5. **Why is This Challenging?**  
   ECC involves complex operations, and representing them in circuits can be expensive in terms of size and computation. This is why special curves (like Baby-jubjub or Tiny-jubjub) are often designed to simplify these operations when used in SNARKs.


### **Key Takeaway**  
"Elliptic curve cryptography in a circuit" means translating elliptic curve operations into a format that can be represented as a computational circuit. This is essential for using elliptic curves efficiently in SNARK systems, where every computation must be provable and verifiable.

### TOY-EXMAPLE ; BABYjubjub
This example discusses **Tiny-jubjub**, a special elliptic curve designed for use in cryptographic systems like SNARKs. Let’s break it down in a simple and fun way:
### **What’s Tiny-jubjub?**
Tiny-jubjub is a compact elliptic curve that’s part of a family of curves built for efficiency and security in cryptographic systems. It’s named after a larger, real-world curve called **Baby-jubjub**, which is widely used in zk-SNARK systems.


### **Curve Definition**
The equation of the Tiny-jubjub curve is:
$$y^2 = x^3 + 8x + 8 \ (\text{mod } 13)$$
Here:
- **Field $F_{13}$**: All calculations are done modulo 13 (i.e., numbers are reduced to their remainders when divided by 13).
- $a = 8$, $b = 8$: These are the curve parameters.
- $4a^3 + 27b^2 \ (\text{mod } 13) = 6 \neq 0$: This ensures the curve is **non-singular**, meaning it doesn’t have any kinks or self-intersections.

---

### **Computing the Curve**
To find the points on the curve:
1. Take every possible value of $x$ and compute $y^2$ using the curve equation.
2. Check which values of $y^2$ have square roots in $F_{13}$. (Remember, in modular arithmetic, not all numbers are perfect squares.)

For example:
- If $x = 1$:  
  $y^2 = 1^3 + 8(1) + 8 \mod 13 = 17 \mod 13 = 4$  
  Since $y^2 = 4$, we find $y = 2$ or $y = 11$ (both are square roots of 4 mod 13).  
  So, $(1, 2)$ and $(1, 11)$ are points on the curve.

Repeating this for all $x$ values gives the following points on the curve:
$$
TJJ_{13} = \{ O,
(1,2), (1,11), (4,0), (5,2), (5,11), (6,5), (6,8), (7,2), (7,11),
(8,5), (8,8), (9,4), (9,9), (10,3), (10,10), (11,6), (11,7), (12,5), (12,8)\}
$$
Where $O$ is the **point at infinity**, the curve’s neutral element.

### **Key Observations**
1. **Number of Points**:  
   The Tiny-jubjub curve has 20 points: 19 valid $(x, y)$ pairs and the point at infinity.
   
2. **Visual Representation**:  
   The right-hand graph shows the points of the curve scattered over $F_{13}$. This scatterplot reflects how elliptic curves look in finite fields—discrete points instead of smooth curves.

3. **Special Properties**:  
   Tiny-jubjub is cryptographically special because it can be represented in multiple forms:
   - **Montgomery Form**: Useful for fast computations.
   - **Twisted Edwards Form**: Popular in SNARK implementations for efficient scalar multiplication.

---

### **Why is this Important?**
Tiny-jubjub isn’t just a toy curve—it demonstrates how elliptic curves are constructed for cryptography. Real-world curves like Baby-jubjub are designed with similar principles but use much larger fields (e.g., 256-bit prime fields) to provide high security.

This example serves as a building block to understand how cryptographic systems, like zk-SNARKs, use elliptic curves to ensure security and efficiency.
---

### **Pen-and-Paper vs. Real-World Elliptic Curves**

1. **Qualitative Similarity**:
   - The elliptic curves used in cryptography are not **qualitatively** different from the smaller examples, like Tiny-jubjub. They still follow the same basic mathematical principles:
     $$
     y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
     $$
   - However, the **scale** of these curves is vastly larger to ensure security.

2. **Cryptographic Security and Prime Field Size**:
   - To make elliptic curves secure for cryptography, the size of the prime field $p$ is critical.
   - Typical prime numbers used in cryptographic elliptic curves are **much larger**, often with binary representations that are at least **twice the size of the desired security level**.
     - For example:
       - If you want **128 bits of security**, the prime modulus $p$ should have a binary size $\geq 256$.
       - This ensures the difficulty of breaking the cryptographic system matches or exceeds the desired security level.

3. **Why Larger Prime Moduli?**
   - Larger prime fields increase the number of points on the curve, making it computationally infeasible to solve problems like the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**, which is the backbone of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).
   - The **Tiny-jubjub** curve or $F_{13}$-based examples are great for learning, but they would be trivial to break due to their small size.

4. **What’s Next?**
   - The text sets up the introduction of a **real-world cryptographic curve** with a larger prime modulus.
   - These curves are used in practical systems like digital signatures (e.g., ECDSA), key exchanges (e.g., ECDH), and zero-knowledge proofs. `nil: check for the EdDSA`

#### 5.1.1.1 Isomorphic affine Short Weierstrass curves

### **Elliptic Curves: Twins in Disguise**
Think of two elliptic curves as twins wearing different outfits—they may look different at first glance, but underneath, they’re mathematically the same. These twins are **isomorphic curves**!

---

### **What Does "Isomorphic" Mean?**
Two elliptic curves:
$$
E_{a,b}(F) : y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
$$
and
$$
E_{a',b'}(F) : y^2 = x^3 + a'x + b'
$$
are isomorphic if there’s a magical scaling factor $c$ (from the field $F$) that transforms the first curve into the second:
$$
a' = a \cdot c^4 \quad \text{and} \quad b' = b \cdot c^6
$$

This scaling doesn’t change the essence of the curve—it just stretches or shrinks it.

---

### **Example: Two Isomorphic Curves**
Let’s work in the finite field $F_5$ (numbers modulo 5), and define two curves:
1. Curve 1: $E_{1,1}(F_5): y^2 = x^3 + x + 1$
2. Curve 2: $E_{16,11}(F_5): y^2 = x^3 + 16x + 11$

Here’s the big question: Are these two curves isomorphic?

---

### **Step 1: Find the Magic $c$**
To check if they’re isomorphic, we need to find $c$ such that:
$$a' = a \cdot c^4 \quad \text{and} \quad b' = b \cdot c^6$$
For Curve 1 ($a = 1$, $b = 1$) and Curve 2 ($a' = 16$, $b' = 11$):

1. Solve $16 \equiv 1 \cdot c^4 \ (\text{mod } 5)$:
   - $c^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } 5)$
   - This means $c = 1$ or $c = 4$, since $c^4 = 1$ modulo 5 for these values.

2. Solve $11 \equiv 1 \cdot c^6 \ (\text{mod } 5)$:
   - $c^6 \equiv 11 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } 5)$
   - Again, $c = 1$ or $c = 4$ works.

---

### **Step 2: Mapping the Points**
Let’s pick $c = 4$. The mapping between points on $E_{1,1}(F_5)$ and $E_{16,11}(F_5)$ is:
$$
(x, y) \mapsto (c^2 \cdot x, c^3 \cdot y)
$$
1. If $(x, y) = (1, 2)$ is a point on $E_{1,1}(F_5)$:
   - $c^2 \cdot x = 4^2 \cdot 1 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } 5)$
   - $c^3 \cdot y = 4^3 \cdot 2 \equiv 64 \cdot 2 \equiv 3 \ (\text{mod } 5)$
   - So, $(1, 2) \mapsto (1, 3)$ on $E_{16,11}(F_5)$.

2. The point at infinity $O$ maps to itself:
   - $O \mapsto O$.

---

### **Step 3: Inverse Mapping**
If we want to reverse the process, we use the inverse scaling factor $c^{-1}$:
$$
(x', y') \mapsto (c^{-2} \cdot x', c^{-3} \cdot y')
$$
For $c = 4$, $c^{-1} = 4$, since $4 \cdot 4 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } 5)$. So, points on $E_{16,11}(F_5)$ map back to $E_{1,1}(F_5)$.


### **Why Should You Care?**
Isomorphic curves let you simplify classification. Instead of dealing with every possible curve, you group all "identical twins" together under one label. It’s like realizing Superman and Clark Kent are the same person—fewer people to keep track of!

#### Example and the exercise
### **Example 74: Isomorphic Curves $E_{1,1}(F_5)$ and $E_{1,4}(F_5)$**

This example explores two isomorphic elliptic curves over the finite field $F_5$:
1. Curve $E_{1,1}(F_5)$: $y^2 = x^3 + x + 1$
2. Curve $E_{1,4}(F_5)$: $y^2 = x^3 + x + 4$

- The set of points for $E_{1,4}(F_5)$ is calculated as:
  $$
  E_{1,4}(F_5) = \{ O, (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3) \}
  $$
- Since $2 \in F_5$ is invertible and satisfies the isomorphism scaling rules $a' = a \cdot c^4$ and $b' = b \cdot c^6$, the two curves are isomorphic.
- The mapping $I : E_{1,1}(F_5) \to E_{1,4}(F_5)$ is defined as:
  $$
  (x, y) \mapsto (4x, 3y)
  $$
  For instance, the point $(4,3) \in E_{1,1}(F_5)$ maps to $(1,4) \in E_{1,4}(F_5)$.

---

### **Example 62: Isomorphic Curves $TJJ_{13}$ and $E_{7,5}(F_{13})$**

This example considers the **Tiny-jubjub curve** $TJJ_{13}$ and a second elliptic curve:
$$
E_{7,5}(F_{13}) : y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 5
$$

- The example asks to show that these two curves are isomorphic over $F_{13}$.
- The isomorphic scaling factor $c$ satisfies:
  $$
  a' = a \cdot c^4 \quad \text{and} \quad b' = b \cdot c^6
  $$
- Compute the mapping function $I$ from $TJJ_{13}$ to $E_{7,5}(F_{13})$, and use it to map all points from $TJJ_{13}$ onto $E_{7,5}(F_{13})$.

### 5.1.1.2 Affine Compressed Representation

Elliptic curve cryptography involves working with points $(x, y)$ on a curve. Each point is represented by its $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate, which are typically elements of a large finite field $F_p$. However, this requires storing both $x$ and $y$, effectively **doubling** the storage size. The technique of **affine compressed representation** (or point compression) reduces the space needed to represent elliptic curve points. Let’s break this down in detail.

### **Why Compress Points?**
- For cryptographically secure curves, like those used in Bitcoin or Ethereum, the field $F_p$ is very large (e.g., 256 bits).
- Each point $(x, y)$ on the elliptic curve requires storing both $x$ and $y$, meaning 512 bits for a single point.
- By using **point compression**, we only store the $x$-coordinate and **one extra bit of information** (called the **sign bit**) to fully reconstruct the point. This reduces storage requirements significantly.

---

### **How Does Point Compression Work?**
1. **Elliptic Curve Equation**:
   - Consider a Short Weierstrass curve:
     $$ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b     $$
   - For a given $x$, we can compute $y^2$. Since $y^2$ is a quadratic residue in $F_p$, it has at most **two possible square roots**, $y_1$ and $y_2$, which satisfy the equation.

2. **Two Possible $y$-Values**:
   - For each $x$, there are two corresponding $y$-values:
     - $y_1$: One square root (e.g., the smaller one in $F_p$).
     - $y_2$: The other square root.
   - Both $(x, y_1)$ and $(x, y_2)$ are valid points on the curve.

3. **Choose a "Sign Bit"**:
   - To compress the point, we store:
     - The $x$-coordinate.
     - A single **bit** to indicate which $y$-value to use:
       - $\text{sign bit} = 0$: Choose $y_1$ (e.g., the root closer to 0).
       - $\text{sign bit} = 1$: Choose $y_2$ (e.g., the root farther from 0).

4. **Reconstruct the Point**:
   - To decompress the point:
     - Compute $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$.
     - Find the two square roots $y_1$ and $y_2$ of $y^2$ in $F_p$.
     - Use the stored **sign bit** to decide which $y$-value to use.

---

### **Edge Case: $y = 0$**
- If $y = 0$, there is only one solution. In this case, both sign bits ($0$ and $1$) give the same result because $y$ is already unique.

---

### **Why Does This Work?**
The key insight is that:
1. The elliptic curve equation ensures there are only two possible $y$-values for each $x$.
2. We can deterministically decide which $y$-value to store using a single bit.

---

### **Example**
Let’s take the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 3$ over $F_{17}$:
1. For $x = 5$:
   - Compute $y^2 = 5^3 + 2(5) + 3 \mod 17$:
     $$
     y^2 = 125 + 10 + 3 \mod 17 = 138 \mod 17 = 2
     $$
   - Find the square roots of $y^2 = 2 \mod 17$: $y_1 = 6$, $y_2 = 11$.
   - Store $x = 5$ and a **sign bit**:
     - $\text{sign bit} = 0$: Use $y_1 = 6$.
     - $\text{sign bit} = 1$: Use $y_2 = 11$.

2. For $x = 3$:
   - Compute $y^2 = 3^3 + 2(3) + 3 \mod 17$:
     $$
     y^2 = 27 + 6 + 3 \mod 17 = 36 \mod 17 = 2
     $$
   - Again, $y_1 = 6$, $y_2 = 11$. The same logic applies.

In compressed form:
- Store $x = 5$, $\text{sign bit} = 0$ (or $1$).
- Reconstruct $y$ using $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ and the sign bit.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Compressed Form**: Saves space by storing only $x$ and a **single bit**.
- **Decompression**: Reconstruct $y$ from $x$ using the elliptic curve equation and the sign bit.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces storage requirements for cryptographically secure elliptic curves, especially in systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Let’s simplify **Example 75** to make the concept of **point compression** easier to understand.

---

### **The Problem: Too Many Bits**
The curve $TJJ_{13}$ lives in the field $F_{13}$, where each number (0 to 12) needs **4 bits** to store. Since a point \((x, y)\) requires both $x$ and $y$, **8 bits** are needed to represent a single point in its uncompressed form.

We want to reduce the storage requirement.

---

### **The Solution: Point Compression**
Instead of storing both $x$ and $y$:
1. **Store only the $x$-coordinate.**
2. **Add a single "sign bit"** to indicate whether $y$ is "closer to 0" or "closer to the modulus 13."

---

### **How Does It Work?**
#### 1. Start with the Curve Equation:
The equation for $TJJ_{13}$ is:
$$
y^2 = x^3 + 8x + 8 \ (\text{mod } 13)
$$
This means:
- For a given $x$, there are **two possible values of $y$** (the square roots of $x^3 + 8x + 8$).

#### 2. Uncompressed Points:
The uncompressed points on the curve are:
$$
TJJ_{13} = \{ O, (1, 2), (1, 11), (4, 0), (5, 2), \dots \}
$$
Each point includes both the $x$-coordinate and the $y$-coordinate.

#### 3. Replace $y$ with a Sign Bit:
To compress the points:
- **Check if $y$ is "closer to 0" or "closer to 13".**
  - Numbers $0, 1, \dots, 6$: **Closer to 0**, use sign bit = **0**.
  - Numbers $7, 8, \dots, 12$: **Closer to 13**, use sign bit = **1**.
- Replace $y$ with its corresponding sign bit.

#### 4. Compressed Points:
After compression, the points look like this:
$$
TJJ_{13} = \{ O, (1, 0), (1, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), \dots \}
$$
Each point now has just the $x$-coordinate and a **1-bit sign**, reducing storage to **5 bits per point**.

---

### **How to Recover $y$ (Decompression)?**
To decompress a point, use the curve equation:
1. Insert the $x$-coordinate into the curve equation to calculate $y^2$:
   - For $(5, 1)$:
     $$
     y^2 = 5^3 + 8(5) + 8 \ (\text{mod } 13) = 4
     $$
2. Find the square roots of $y^2$ in $F_{13}$:
   - The square roots of $4$ in $F_{13}$ are $y = 2$ and $y = 11$.
3. Use the sign bit to choose the correct $y$:
   - **Sign bit = 1**: Pick the value "closer to 13," so $y = 11$.
   - Decompressed point: $(5, 11)$.

---

### **Why is This Useful?**
By using point compression:
- Storage requirements are reduced.
- Instead of storing two field elements ($x, y$), we store only $x$ and a single bit.
- This is crucial for efficient cryptographic implementations like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## 5.1.2 Affine Representation

### **Affine Group Law: Making Math Magical**
Elliptic curves are not just pretty shapes—they’re secret math clubs where points get together, combine, and follow some amazing rules. Let’s explore their group law with a touch of fun.

### **Welcome to the Party: The Rules**
Every club needs rules, and elliptic curves are no exception. Here’s what happens in the **Elliptic Curve Point Club**:

1. **Point at Infinity ($O$): The VIP Guest**
   - $O$ is like the **neutral friend** at the party. Whenever you add $O$ to any point $P$, nothing changes:
     $$ P \oplus O = P    $$

2. **Adding Two Points ($P \oplus Q$): Chord Rule**
   - Think of $P$ and $Q$ as two people chatting at the party.
   - A **chord** (line) connects them and intersects the curve at a third point $R'$.
   - But the curve has a weird rule: it doesn’t want to keep $R'$—it flips it across the x-axis to get $R$. Now $R$ is the sum of $P$ and $Q$:
     $$
     P \oplus Q = R
     $$

3. **Doubling a Point ($P \oplus P$): Tangent Rule**
   - If $P$ is standing alone, it can "talk to itself" via a **tangent line**.
   - This tangent hits the curve at another point $R'$, which is also flipped across the x-axis to get $R$. That’s $2P$.

4. **Inverses: Reflection Time**
   - Every point has an inverse. It’s like its evil twin, just reflected across the x-axis:
     $$P = (x, y) \quad \text{and} \quad -P = (x, -y)  $$

### **Geometric Explanation: Drawing the Fun**
Imagine the elliptic curve is a dance floor. Here’s how the party rules play out geometrically:

- **Adding Two Points**: $P$ and $Q$ are dancing, and their line hits another point $R'$. Instead of keeping $R'$, we reflect it across the x-axis for symmetry.
- **Doubling a Point**: A single point gets bored and uses a tangent to hit the curve again. Same flipping rule applies.

### **Math Meets Magic: The Algebra**
Let’s say the curve is defined by:
$$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$
We need algebraic formulas to make the group law computer-friendly.

1. **Neutral Element ($O$)**:
   - $O$ is the identity:
     $$     P \oplus O = P     $$

2. **Inverse**:
   - The inverse of $P = (x, y)$ is $-P = (x, -y)$.

3. **Doubling a Point ($P = Q$):**
   - If $P = (x_1, y_1)$, the tangent slope is:
     $$
     m = \frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}
     $$
   - The new point $2P = (x', y')$ is:
     $$
     x' = m^2 - 2x_1, \quad y' = m(x_1 - x') - y_1
     $$

4. **Adding Two Points ($P \neq Q$):**
   - If $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$:
     $$
     m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
     $$
   - The result $R = (x_3, y_3)$ is:
     $$
     x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2, \quad y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1
     $$

5. **Vertical Line Case**:
   - If $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 \neq y_2$, the line is vertical, and the result is:
     $$
     P \oplus Q = O
     $$

### **Elliptic Curves: The Math Party’s MVP**
Why is this group law cool?
- It turns the curve into a **commutative group**, which means you can do secure cryptographic tricks like key exchanges and digital signatures.
- It’s visually intuitive (think about lines and tangents) but also has powerful algebra behind it.

---

### **Final Thought: Why Flipping is Fun**
The $x$-axis flipping rule ensures consistency. Without it, we wouldn’t have a well-behaved group, and the elliptic curve party would turn into chaos.
Here’s the extracted paragraph:


**Notation and Symbols:**

Let $F$ be a field and $E(F)$ an elliptic curve over $F$. We write $\oplus$ for the group law on $E(F)$, $(E(F), \oplus)$ for the commutative group of elliptic curve points, and use the additive notation (notation $4$) on this group. If $P$ is a point on a Short Weierstrass curve with $P = (x, 0)$, then $P$ is called **self-inverse**.

Let's break this down with a very detailed example, step by step, so it's crystal clear how elliptic curve point addition and doubling work in $E_{1,1}(F_5)$, the elliptic curve over the field $F_5$ with the equation:

$$y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 \ (\text{mod } 5) $$

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Curve**
The curve $E_{1,1}(F_5)$ has the following 9 elements:
$$
E_{1,1}(F_5) = \{ O, (0, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (0, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4) \}
$$
- $O$: The point at infinity, acting as the **neutral element**.
- Points like \((x, y)\) satisfy the curve equation $y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 \ (\text{mod } 5)$.

---

### **Step 2: Adding Two Points ($P \oplus Q$)**
Let’s compute $(0, 1) \oplus (4, 2)$ using the **chord rule**.

1. **The Formula**:
   For $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$:
   - Slope: $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \ (\text{mod } 5)$
   - Resulting point: $R = (x_3, y_3)$, where:
     $$
     x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2 \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$
     $$
     y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$

2. **Plug in the Points**:
   - $P = (0, 1)$, $Q = (4, 2)$.
   - Compute $m$:
     $$
     m = \frac{2 - 1}{4 - 0} \ (\text{mod } 5) = \frac{1}{4} \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$
     Since $4^{-1} \ (\text{mod } 5) = 4$ (the multiplicative inverse of 4 mod 5), we get:
     $$
     m = 1 \cdot 4 = 4 \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$

3. **Find $x_3$ and $y_3$**:
   - Compute $x_3$:
     $$
     x_3 = 4^2 - 0 - 4 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 16 - 4 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 2
     $$
   - Compute $y_3$:
     $$
     y_3 = 4(0 - 2) - 1 \ (\text{mod } 5) = -8 - 1 \ (\text{mod } 5) = -9 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 1
     $$

4. **Result**:
   $$
   (0, 1) \oplus (4, 2) = (2, 1)
   $$

---

### **Step 3: Doubling a Point ($P \oplus P$)**
Now, let’s double the point $(4, 2)$ using the **tangent rule**.

1. **The Formula**:
   For $P = (x_1, y_1)$, the tangent slope is:
   $$
   m = \frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1} \ (\text{mod } 5)
   $$
   Resulting point $R = (x', y')$:
   $$
   x' = m^2 - 2x_1 \ (\text{mod } 5)
   $$
   $$
   y' = m(x_1 - x') - y_1 \ (\text{mod } 5)
   $$

2. **Plug in the Point**:
   - $P = (4, 2)$, $a = 1$.
   - Compute $m$:
     $$
     m = \frac{3(4^2) + 1}{2(2)} \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$
     Simplify the numerator:
     $$
     3(16) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 4
     $$
     Compute $2(2) = 4 \ (\text{mod } 5)$. Thus:
     $$
     m = \frac{4}{4} \ (\text{mod } 5) = 1
     $$

3. **Find $x'$ and $y'$**:
   - Compute $x'$:
     $$
     x' = 1^2 - 2(4) \ (\text{mod } 5) = 1 - 8 \ (\text{mod } 5) = -7 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 3
     $$
   - Compute $y'$:
     $$
     y' = 1(4 - 3) - 2 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 1(1) - 2 \ (\text{mod } 5) = -1 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 4
     $$

4. **Result**:
   $$
   (4, 2) \oplus (4, 2) = (3, 4)
   $$

---

### **Final Results**
- $(0, 1) \oplus (4, 2) = (2, 1)$

### 5.1.2.1 Scalar multiplication 


### **Scalar Multiplication: The Repeated Selfie Game**
Imagine you’re a photographer at an elliptic curve party. You want to create a photo series where every person (point $P$) multiplies themselves $m$-times in a mirror. The more they "multiply," the more fabulous and unique they look. This is **scalar multiplication**—adding the same point to itself over and over until you get a new, shiny result!

### **What’s Happening at the Party?**
1. **P Meets P**:
   - The first selfie is just $P$ hanging out alone. Easy peasy:
     $$   [1]P = P   $$
   - Now, $P$ decides to double itself. It pulls out a mirror (tangent line), finds a new reflection $2P$, and BOOM—fabulous upgrade.

2. **P Keeps Multiplying**:
   - Next, $P$ thinks, "Let’s triple this selfie magic." It partners with $2P$, grabs a chord, and finds a third reflection $3P$. 
   - Keep doing this, and $P$ keeps generating new, stylish points on the curve.

### **The Rulebook: How to Multiply Points**
**Scalar multiplication** is like a recipe for selfies:
1. Start with your base point $P$.
2. Double it, add it, repeat it. Math magic ensures you always land back on the curve (no awkward off-curve selfies allowed).
3. The result is a new point $[m]P$, where $m$ is the "selfie count."

### **How Does P Do It?**
#### **Case 1: Doubling (Tangent Rule)**
When $P$ doubles itself, it uses the **tangent line selfie hack**:
- The tangent line at $P$ touches the curve again at a point $R'$.
- Flip $R'$ across the x-axis to get $2P$, the new glam pose.

#### **Case 2: Adding (Chord Rule)**
When $P$ and another point $Q$ team up:
- Draw a line (chord) between them.
- This line intersects the curve at $R'$.
- Reflect $R'$ across the x-axis to get $P + Q$—the ultimate team-up selfie.

### **An Example: Meet Curve $E(F_5)$**
The elliptic curve is:
$$y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 \ (\text{mod } 5)$$
And the party guest list (points) is:
$$
E(F_5) = \{ O, (0, 1), (0, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3) \}
$$

Let’s have $P = (0, 1)$ start the selfie chain.

1. **Double the Fun ($2P$):**
   - Use the tangent rule:
     $$
     x' = \left( \frac{3x^2 + a}{2y} \right)^2 - 2x
     $$
     Substitute $x = 0$, $y = 1$, $a = 1$:
     $$
     m = \frac{3(0^2) + 1}{2(1)} = \frac{1}{2} \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$
     The inverse of $2 \ (\text{mod } 5)$ is $3$, so:
     $$
     m = 1 \cdot 3 = 3 \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$
     Now:
     $$
     x' = 3^2 - 2(0) = 9 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 4
     $$
     $$
     y' = m(x - x') - y = 3(0 - 4) - 1 = -13 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 2
     $$
     So, $2P = (4, 2)$.

2. **Triple the Drama ($3P$):**
   - Add $P = (0, 1)$ and $2P = (4, 2)$ using the chord rule:
     $$
     m = \frac{2 - 1}{4 - 0} = \frac{1}{4} \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$
     The inverse of $4 \ (\text{mod } 5)$ is $4$, so:
     $$
     m = 1 \cdot 4 = 4
     $$
     Now:
     $$
     x' = 4^2 - 0 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 2
     $$
     $$
     y' = 4(0 - 2) - 1 = -8 - 1 = -9 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 1
     $$
     So, $3P = (2, 1)$.

### **Why Is Scalar Multiplication Cool?**
- It’s the **engine of elliptic curve cryptography**. Your private key is the scalar $m$, and your public key is $[m]P$.
- Multiplying is easy, but reversing the process (figuring out $m$ from $[m]P$) is like solving a Rubik’s cube in the dark—it’s nearly impossible without the key!

### **Party Trick: Infinite Multiplications**
After enough selfies, $P$ wraps back to $O$ (the point at infinity). This is the "end of the party" when the group order is reached. Every elliptic curve point eventually loops back like a cosmic boomerang.


So, scalar multiplication is not just math—it’s a **glamorous point dance on the elliptic curve dance floor**! 💃✨
