# Introduction to Elliptic Curves

## Why Elliptic Curves?
Elliptic curves are fascinating geometric objects, living in the mathematical realm of projective planes. They are essentially a collection of points satisfying specific equations, but their real magic lies in their structure. In the world of cryptography, they shine because, over fields with positive characteristics, elliptic curves form finite, cyclic groups—a critical property for secure systems. What's even cooler? The Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP), a cornerstone of cryptographic security, is believed to be hard on these curves when the field characteristic is sufficiently large.

A special breed of these curves, known as pairing-friendly curves, comes with additional cryptographic superpowers, enabling group pairings with unique advantages. These curves have proven invaluable in cutting-edge applications like SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge). Throughout this chapter, we’ll delve into elliptic curves, focusing on their pairing-based use in SNARKs, all while leaning on the mathematical groundwork laid in earlier sections.


# The Short Weierstrass Form
Alright, let’s make this fun and easy to digest!


### **Affine Short Weierstrass Form – A Simple Introduction**

Imagine a magical land where math meets geometry, and the rulers are the mighty **elliptic curves**. These rulers govern the kingdom using an equation as their law:

$$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b $$

But here’s the catch: their rule only works as long as $4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0$. If this condition isn’t met, the curve collapses into chaos (with things like cusps and self-intersections)!


### **What’s an Elliptic Curve Anyway?**

At its heart, an **elliptic curve** is just a fancy name for a set of points $(x, y)$ that follow the magical law above. Imagine drawing a wiggly loop on paper (or on a graph). For example:

- If $a = -2$ and $b = 1$, the equation becomes:
  $$
  y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 1
  $$
  Over a smooth, continuous field (like the rational numbers, $Q$), this curve would look like a beautiful, wavy figure-eight-ish shape.

- But here’s where the magic gets funky: If you restrict $x$ and $y$ to a **finite field**, like $F_5$ (where all calculations are done modulo 5), the curve doesn’t look like a smooth line anymore. Instead, it’s a scattered collection of points. Imagine tossing blue confetti on a graph—those are your points on the curve!


### **The Point at Infinity – The Curve’s Superhero**

Elliptic curves have a special “missing point” to make them whole. This is called the **point at infinity**, denoted as $O$. It doesn’t live on the regular plane but acts as the **identity element** for addition (like 0 in regular arithmetic). Think of it as the curve’s “reset button”—it makes the math work behind the scenes.


### **Example Time!**

Let’s make an elliptic curve over the finite field $F_5$ (numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, with arithmetic modulo 5). Take the equation:
$$y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 \ \ (\text{mod } 5)$$

Here’s how it works:
1. Plug in all possible $x$-values ($0, 1, 2, 3, 4$).
2. Compute $x^3 + x + 1$, modulo 5.
3. Find all $y^2$-values that match this result.

Let’s try it:
- If $x = 0$: $y^2 = 0^3 + 0 + 1 = 1$, so $y = 1$ or $y = 4$ (since $1^2 = 1$ and $4^2 = 1$ mod 5).
- If $x = 2$: $y^2 = 2^3 + 2 + 1 = 11 \mod 5 = 1$, so $y = 1$ or $y = 4$.

After going through all $x$-values, we get:
$$E_{1,1}(F_5) = \{ O, (0,1), (0,4), (2,1), (2,4), \dots \}$$

It’s just a collection of points (plus the point at infinity), and that’s your elliptic curve over $F_5$ !


### **Geometric Intuition**

If you graph this curve over $\mathbf{Q}$ (rational numbers), it looks smooth and continuous. But over finite fields, it’s like a starry night—dots scattered across the plane. Both are beautiful in their own ways.

### **Why Should I Care?**

This simple equation is the backbone of modern cryptography! The "curve points" are like a secret codebook, and their mathematical structure (like addition and scalar multiplication) makes elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) both secure and efficient.


So there you have it—elliptic curves in the affine form! It’s like building a kingdom of points with rules so magical, they protect your secrets in the digital world.

This part of the text highlights the differences in how elliptic curves look depending on the field over which they are defined. Let me simplify and explain it in a fun way:

### **Elliptic Curves: Two Worlds, Same Equation**

Imagine you’ve got the same magical equation for an elliptic curve:
$$
y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 1
$$
But depending on the “world” you’re in—whether it’s the rational numbers ($Q$) or a prime field like $F_{9973}$—this curve looks completely different!

---

### **World 1: Rational Numbers ($Q$)**
In the land of rational numbers, every $x$ and $y$ can be fractions or integers, and the curve looks like a smooth, flowing wave. It’s the kind of shape you’d expect from the word “curve.” (Check out the left graph in the image!)

---

### **World 2: Finite Field ($F_{9973}$)**
Now step into the land of finite fields, like $F_{9973}$, where everything is done modulo 9973. Here:
- $x$ and $y$ can only take integer values between 0 and 9972.
- The curve isn’t a smooth wave anymore. Instead, it’s a scattered collection of points (as shown on the right). Every blue dot represents a solution to the equation.

It’s like the curve got turned into a starry sky with discrete points instead of a smooth line. This is because finite fields don’t have the same “continuous” nature as rational numbers.

---

### **Why Does This Happen?**
It all boils down to how numbers behave in these fields:
- In $Q$, there’s an infinite number of points to connect, so the curve feels smooth.
- In $F_{9973}$, there’s only a finite number of possible $(x, y)$ pairs, so the curve looks more like a scatterplot.

---

### **Why Care About $4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0$?**
This condition ensures the curve is **non-singular**, meaning it doesn’t have any weird kinks (cusps) or points where it intersects itself. Without this, the “curve’s law” (group operations) would break, and math wizards (cryptographers) wouldn’t be able to use it properly.

---

### **Takeaway**
Elliptic curves can live in two different worlds—smooth and infinite, or discrete and finite. Both are beautiful, but cryptographers love the second world (finite fields) because it’s secure and computationally efficient. The scattered points may not look like a curve, but they carry all the magic of elliptic curve math!

### **What Does "Elliptic Curve Cryptography in a Circuit" Mean?**

When developing **SNARKs** (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge), we often need to perform **elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)** inside what is known as a **circuit**. Here's what this means step by step:

1. **What is a Circuit?**  
   A circuit is a structured representation of a computation. Think of it like a flowchart or a set of connected logic gates in digital electronics, but for mathematical operations. In cryptographic contexts:
   - A circuit consists of a series of gates performing operations like addition, multiplication, etc.
   - The goal is to represent a complex computation (e.g., elliptic curve point addition) as a sequence of simpler steps that can be efficiently verified.

2. **Why Use ECC in a Circuit?**  
   SNARKs are used to prove that a computation is correct without revealing its details. If the computation involves cryptographic operations, like ECC (used for digital signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, etc.), then these operations must also be represented in the circuit.

3. **SNARK-Friendly Implementation**:  
   ECC needs to be implemented in a **SNARK-friendly way**. This means:
   - The elliptic curve operations (like point addition or scalar multiplication) are broken down into simple arithmetic operations.
   - These operations are then arranged into a circuit that minimizes complexity (e.g., number of gates) and maximizes efficiency.

4. **Example**:  
   Suppose you're verifying a digital signature that uses ECC as part of a larger SNARK proof. To do this:
   - The elliptic curve equations (e.g., $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$) are transformed into arithmetic circuits.
   - Operations like adding two points on the curve or performing scalar multiplication are translated into sequences of additions, multiplications, and inverses, all within the finite field.

5. **Why is This Challenging?**  
   ECC involves complex operations, and representing them in circuits can be expensive in terms of size and computation. This is why special curves (like Baby-jubjub or Tiny-jubjub) are often designed to simplify these operations when used in SNARKs.


### **Key Takeaway**  
"Elliptic curve cryptography in a circuit" means translating elliptic curve operations into a format that can be represented as a computational circuit. This is essential for using elliptic curves efficiently in SNARK systems, where every computation must be provable and verifiable.

### TOY-EXMAPLE ; BABYjubjub
This example discusses **Tiny-jubjub**, a special elliptic curve designed for use in cryptographic systems like SNARKs. Let’s break it down in a simple and fun way:
### **What’s Tiny-jubjub?**
Tiny-jubjub is a compact elliptic curve that’s part of a family of curves built for efficiency and security in cryptographic systems. It’s named after a larger, real-world curve called **Baby-jubjub**, which is widely used in zk-SNARK systems.


### **Curve Definition**
The equation of the Tiny-jubjub curve is:
$$y^2 = x^3 + 8x + 8 \ (\text{mod } 13)$$
Here:
- **Field $F_{13}$**: All calculations are done modulo 13 (i.e., numbers are reduced to their remainders when divided by 13).
- $a = 8$, $b = 8$: These are the curve parameters.
- $4a^3 + 27b^2 \ (\text{mod } 13) = 6 \neq 0$: This ensures the curve is **non-singular**, meaning it doesn’t have any kinks or self-intersections.

---

### **Computing the Curve**
To find the points on the curve:
1. Take every possible value of $x$ and compute $y^2$ using the curve equation.
2. Check which values of $y^2$ have square roots in $F_{13}$. (Remember, in modular arithmetic, not all numbers are perfect squares.)

For example:
- If $x = 1$:  
  $y^2 = 1^3 + 8(1) + 8 \mod 13 = 17 \mod 13 = 4$  
  Since $y^2 = 4$, we find $y = 2$ or $y = 11$ (both are square roots of 4 mod 13).  
  So, $(1, 2)$ and $(1, 11)$ are points on the curve.

Repeating this for all $x$ values gives the following points on the curve:
$$
TJJ_{13} = \{ O,
(1,2), (1,11), (4,0), (5,2), (5,11), (6,5), (6,8), (7,2), (7,11),
(8,5), (8,8), (9,4), (9,9), (10,3), (10,10), (11,6), (11,7), (12,5), (12,8)\}
$$
Where $O$ is the **point at infinity**, the curve’s neutral element.

### **Key Observations**
1. **Number of Points**:  
   The Tiny-jubjub curve has 20 points: 19 valid $(x, y)$ pairs and the point at infinity.
   
2. **Visual Representation**:  
   The right-hand graph shows the points of the curve scattered over $F_{13}$. This scatterplot reflects how elliptic curves look in finite fields—discrete points instead of smooth curves.

3. **Special Properties**:  
   Tiny-jubjub is cryptographically special because it can be represented in multiple forms:
   - **Montgomery Form**: Useful for fast computations.
   - **Twisted Edwards Form**: Popular in SNARK implementations for efficient scalar multiplication.

---

### **Why is this Important?**
Tiny-jubjub isn’t just a toy curve—it demonstrates how elliptic curves are constructed for cryptography. Real-world curves like Baby-jubjub are designed with similar principles but use much larger fields (e.g., 256-bit prime fields) to provide high security.

This example serves as a building block to understand how cryptographic systems, like zk-SNARKs, use elliptic curves to ensure security and efficiency.
---

### **Pen-and-Paper vs. Real-World Elliptic Curves**

1. **Qualitative Similarity**:
   - The elliptic curves used in cryptography are not **qualitatively** different from the smaller examples, like Tiny-jubjub. They still follow the same basic mathematical principles:
     $$
     y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
     $$
   - However, the **scale** of these curves is vastly larger to ensure security.

2. **Cryptographic Security and Prime Field Size**:
   - To make elliptic curves secure for cryptography, the size of the prime field $p$ is critical.
   - Typical prime numbers used in cryptographic elliptic curves are **much larger**, often with binary representations that are at least **twice the size of the desired security level**.
     - For example:
       - If you want **128 bits of security**, the prime modulus $p$ should have a binary size $\geq 256$.
       - This ensures the difficulty of breaking the cryptographic system matches or exceeds the desired security level.

3. **Why Larger Prime Moduli?**
   - Larger prime fields increase the number of points on the curve, making it computationally infeasible to solve problems like the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**, which is the backbone of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).
   - The **Tiny-jubjub** curve or $F_{13}$-based examples are great for learning, but they would be trivial to break due to their small size.

4. **What’s Next?**
   - The text sets up the introduction of a **real-world cryptographic curve** with a larger prime modulus.
   - These curves are used in practical systems like digital signatures (e.g., ECDSA), key exchanges (e.g., ECDH), and zero-knowledge proofs. `nil: check for the EdDSA`

#### 5.1.1.1 Isomorphic affine Short Weierstrass curves

### **Elliptic Curves: Twins in Disguise**
Think of two elliptic curves as twins wearing different outfits—they may look different at first glance, but underneath, they’re mathematically the same. These twins are **isomorphic curves**!

---

### **What Does "Isomorphic" Mean?**
Two elliptic curves:
$$
E_{a,b}(F) : y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
$$
and
$$
E_{a',b'}(F) : y^2 = x^3 + a'x + b'
$$
are isomorphic if there’s a magical scaling factor $c$ (from the field $F$) that transforms the first curve into the second:
$$
a' = a \cdot c^4 \quad \text{and} \quad b' = b \cdot c^6
$$

This scaling doesn’t change the essence of the curve—it just stretches or shrinks it.
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkrnSSy7ke.png)

---

### **Example: Two Isomorphic Curves**
Let’s work in the finite field $F_5$ (numbers modulo 5), and define two curves:
1. Curve 1: $E_{1,1}(F_5): y^2 = x^3 + x + 1$
2. Curve 2: $E_{16,11}(F_5): y^2 = x^3 + 16x + 11$

Here’s the big question: Are these two curves isomorphic?

---

### **Step 1: Find the Magic $c$**
To check if they’re isomorphic, we need to find $c$ such that:
$$a' = a \cdot c^4 \quad \text{and} \quad b' = b \cdot c^6$$
For Curve 1 ($a = 1$, $b = 1$) and Curve 2 ($a' = 16$, $b' = 11$):

1. Solve $16 \equiv 1 \cdot c^4 \ (\text{mod } 5)$:
   - $c^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } 5)$
   - This means $c = 1$ or $c = 4$, since $c^4 = 1$ modulo 5 for these values.

2. Solve $11 \equiv 1 \cdot c^6 \ (\text{mod } 5)$:
   - $c^6 \equiv 11 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } 5)$
   - Again, $c = 1$ or $c = 4$ works.

---

### **Step 2: Mapping the Points**
Let’s pick $c = 4$. The mapping between points on $E_{1,1}(F_5)$ and $E_{16,11}(F_5)$ is:
$$
(x, y) \mapsto (c^2 \cdot x, c^3 \cdot y)
$$
1. If $(x, y) = (1, 2)$ is a point on $E_{1,1}(F_5)$:
   - $c^2 \cdot x = 4^2 \cdot 1 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } 5)$
   - $c^3 \cdot y = 4^3 \cdot 2 \equiv 64 \cdot 2 \equiv 3 \ (\text{mod } 5)$
   - So, $(1, 2) \mapsto (1, 3)$ on $E_{16,11}(F_5)$.

2. The point at infinity $O$ maps to itself:
   - $O \mapsto O$.

---

### **Step 3: Inverse Mapping**
If we want to reverse the process, we use the inverse scaling factor $c^{-1}$:
$$
(x', y') \mapsto (c^{-2} \cdot x', c^{-3} \cdot y')
$$
For $c = 4$, $c^{-1} = 4$, since $4 \cdot 4 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } 5)$. So, points on $E_{16,11}(F_5)$ map back to $E_{1,1}(F_5)$.


### **Why Should You Care?**
Isomorphic curves let you simplify classification. Instead of dealing with every possible curve, you group all "identical twins" together under one label. It’s like realizing Superman and Clark Kent are the same person—fewer people to keep track of!

#### Example and the exercise
### **Example 74: Isomorphic Curves $E_{1,1}(F_5)$ and $E_{1,4}(F_5)$**

This example explores two isomorphic elliptic curves over the finite field $F_5$:
1. Curve $E_{1,1}(F_5)$: $y^2 = x^3 + x + 1$
2. Curve $E_{1,4}(F_5)$: $y^2 = x^3 + x + 4$

- The set of points for $E_{1,4}(F_5)$ is calculated as:
  $$
  E_{1,4}(F_5) = \{ O, (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3) \}
  $$
- Since $2 \in F_5$ is invertible and satisfies the isomorphism scaling rules $a' = a \cdot c^4$ and $b' = b \cdot c^6$, the two curves are isomorphic.
- The mapping $I : E_{1,1}(F_5) \to E_{1,4}(F_5)$ is defined as:
  $$
  (x, y) \mapsto (4x, 3y)
  $$
  For instance, the point $(4,3) \in E_{1,1}(F_5)$ maps to $(1,4) \in E_{1,4}(F_5)$.

---

### **Example 62: Isomorphic Curves $TJJ_{13}$ and $E_{7,5}(F_{13})$**

This example considers the **Tiny-jubjub curve** $TJJ_{13}$ and a second elliptic curve:
$$
E_{7,5}(F_{13}) : y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 5
$$

- The example asks to show that these two curves are isomorphic over $F_{13}$.
- The isomorphic scaling factor $c$ satisfies:
  $$
  a' = a \cdot c^4 \quad \text{and} \quad b' = b \cdot c^6
  $$
- Compute the mapping function $I$ from $TJJ_{13}$ to $E_{7,5}(F_{13})$, and use it to map all points from $TJJ_{13}$ onto $E_{7,5}(F_{13})$.

### 5.1.1.2 Affine Compressed Representation

Elliptic curve cryptography involves working with points $(x, y)$ on a curve. Each point is represented by its $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate, which are typically elements of a large finite field $F_p$. However, this requires storing both $x$ and $y$, effectively **doubling** the storage size. The technique of **affine compressed representation** (or point compression) reduces the space needed to represent elliptic curve points. Let’s break this down in detail.

### **Why Compress Points?**
- For cryptographically secure curves, like those used in Bitcoin or Ethereum, the field $F_p$ is very large (e.g., 256 bits).
- Each point $(x, y)$ on the elliptic curve requires storing both $x$ and $y$, meaning 512 bits for a single point.
- By using **point compression**, we only store the $x$-coordinate and **one extra bit of information** (called the **sign bit**) to fully reconstruct the point. This reduces storage requirements significantly.

---

### **How Does Point Compression Work?**
1. **Elliptic Curve Equation**:
   - Consider a Short Weierstrass curve:
     $$ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b     $$
   - For a given $x$, we can compute $y^2$. Since $y^2$ is a quadratic residue in $F_p$, it has at most **two possible square roots**, $y_1$ and $y_2$, which satisfy the equation.

2. **Two Possible $y$-Values**:
   - For each $x$, there are two corresponding $y$-values:
     - $y_1$: One square root (e.g., the smaller one in $F_p$).
     - $y_2$: The other square root.
   - Both $(x, y_1)$ and $(x, y_2)$ are valid points on the curve.

3. **Choose a "Sign Bit"**:
   - To compress the point, we store:
     - The $x$-coordinate.
     - A single **bit** to indicate which $y$-value to use:
       - $\text{sign bit} = 0$: Choose $y_1$ (e.g., the root closer to 0).
       - $\text{sign bit} = 1$: Choose $y_2$ (e.g., the root farther from 0).

4. **Reconstruct the Point**:
   - To decompress the point:
     - Compute $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$.
     - Find the two square roots $y_1$ and $y_2$ of $y^2$ in $F_p$.
     - Use the stored **sign bit** to decide which $y$-value to use.

---

### **Edge Case: $y = 0$**
- If $y = 0$, there is only one solution. In this case, both sign bits ($0$ and $1$) give the same result because $y$ is already unique.

---

### **Why Does This Work?**
The key insight is that:
1. The elliptic curve equation ensures there are only two possible $y$-values for each $x$.
2. We can deterministically decide which $y$-value to store using a single bit.

---

### **Example**
Let’s take the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 3$ over $F_{17}$:
1. For $x = 5$:
   - Compute $y^2 = 5^3 + 2(5) + 3 \mod 17$:
     $$
     y^2 = 125 + 10 + 3 \mod 17 = 138 \mod 17 = 2
     $$
   - Find the square roots of $y^2 = 2 \mod 17$: $y_1 = 6$, $y_2 = 11$.
   - Store $x = 5$ and a **sign bit**:
     - $\text{sign bit} = 0$: Use $y_1 = 6$.
     - $\text{sign bit} = 1$: Use $y_2 = 11$.

2. For $x = 3$:
   - Compute $y^2 = 3^3 + 2(3) + 3 \mod 17$:
     $$
     y^2 = 27 + 6 + 3 \mod 17 = 36 \mod 17 = 2
     $$
   - Again, $y_1 = 6$, $y_2 = 11$. The same logic applies.

In compressed form:
- Store $x = 5$, $\text{sign bit} = 0$ (or $1$).
- Reconstruct $y$ using $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ and the sign bit.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Compressed Form**: Saves space by storing only $x$ and a **single bit**.
- **Decompression**: Reconstruct $y$ from $x$ using the elliptic curve equation and the sign bit.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces storage requirements for cryptographically secure elliptic curves, especially in systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Let’s simplify **Example 75** to make the concept of **point compression** easier to understand.

---

### **The Problem: Too Many Bits**
The curve $TJJ_{13}$ lives in the field $F_{13}$, where each number (0 to 12) needs **4 bits** to store. Since a point $(x, y)$ requires both $x$ and $y$, **8 bits** are needed to represent a single point in its uncompressed form.

We want to reduce the storage requirement.

---

### **The Solution: Point Compression**
Instead of storing both $x$ and $y$:
1. **Store only the $x$-coordinate.**
2. **Add a single "sign bit"** to indicate whether $y$ is "closer to 0" or "closer to the modulus 13."

---

### **How Does It Work?**
#### 1. Start with the Curve Equation:
The equation for $TJJ_{13}$ is:
$$
y^2 = x^3 + 8x + 8 \ (\text{mod } 13)
$$
This means:
- For a given $x$, there are **two possible values of $y$** (the square roots of $x^3 + 8x + 8$).

#### 2. Uncompressed Points:
The uncompressed points on the curve are:
$$
TJJ_{13} = \{ O, (1, 2), (1, 11), (4, 0), (5, 2), \dots \}
$$
Each point includes both the $x$-coordinate and the $y$-coordinate.

#### 3. Replace $y$ with a Sign Bit:
To compress the points:
- **Check if $y$ is "closer to 0" or "closer to 13".**
  - Numbers $0, 1, \dots, 6$: **Closer to 0**, use sign bit = **0**.
  - Numbers $7, 8, \dots, 12$: **Closer to 13**, use sign bit = **1**.
- Replace $y$ with its corresponding sign bit.

#### 4. Compressed Points:
After compression, the points look like this:
$$
TJJ_{13} = \{ O, (1, 0), (1, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), \dots \}
$$
Each point now has just the $x$-coordinate and a **1-bit sign**, reducing storage to **5 bits per point**.

---

### **How to Recover $y$ (Decompression)?**
To decompress a point, use the curve equation:
1. Insert the $x$-coordinate into the curve equation to calculate $y^2$:
   - For $(5, 1)$:
     $$
     y^2 = 5^3 + 8(5) + 8 \ (\text{mod } 13) = 4
     $$
2. Find the square roots of $y^2$ in $F_{13}$:
   - The square roots of $4$ in $F_{13}$ are $y = 2$ and $y = 11$.
3. Use the sign bit to choose the correct $y$:
   - **Sign bit = 1**: Pick the value "closer to 13," so $y = 11$.
   - Decompressed point: $(5, 11)$.

---

### **Why is This Useful?**
By using point compression:
- Storage requirements are reduced.
- Instead of storing two field elements ($x, y$), we store only $x$ and a single bit.
- This is crucial for efficient cryptographic implementations like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## 5.1.2 Affine Representation

### **Affine Group Law: Making Math Magical**
Elliptic curves are not just pretty shapes—they’re secret math clubs where points get together, combine, and follow some amazing rules. Let’s explore their group law with a touch of fun.

### **Welcome to the Party: The Rules**
Every club needs rules, and elliptic curves are no exception. Here’s what happens in the **Elliptic Curve Point Club**:

1. **Point at Infinity ($O$): The VIP Guest**
   - $O$ is like the **neutral friend** at the party. Whenever you add $O$ to any point $P$, nothing changes:
     $$ P \oplus O = P    $$

2. **Adding Two Points ($P \oplus Q$): Chord Rule**
   - Think of $P$ and $Q$ as two people chatting at the party.
   - A **chord** (line) connects them and intersects the curve at a third point $R'$.
   - But the curve has a weird rule: it doesn’t want to keep $R'$—it flips it across the x-axis to get $R$. Now $R$ is the sum of $P$ and $Q$:
     $$
     P \oplus Q = R
     $$

3. **Doubling a Point ($P \oplus P$): Tangent Rule**
   - If $P$ is standing alone, it can "talk to itself" via a **tangent line**.
   - This tangent hits the curve at another point $R'$, which is also flipped across the x-axis to get $R$. That’s $2P$.

4. **Inverses: Reflection Time**
   - Every point has an inverse. It’s like its evil twin, just reflected across the x-axis:
     $$P = (x, y) \quad \text{and} \quad -P = (x, -y)  $$

### **Geometric Explanation: Drawing the Fun**
Imagine the elliptic curve is a dance floor. Here’s how the party rules play out geometrically:

- **Adding Two Points**: $P$ and $Q$ are dancing, and their line hits another point $R'$. Instead of keeping $R'$, we reflect it across the x-axis for symmetry.
- **Doubling a Point**: A single point gets bored and uses a tangent to hit the curve again. Same flipping rule applies.

### **Math Meets Magic: The Algebra**
Let’s say the curve is defined by:
$$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$
We need algebraic formulas to make the group law computer-friendly.

1. **Neutral Element ($O$)**:
   - $O$ is the identity:
     $$     P \oplus O = P     $$

2. **Inverse**:
   - The inverse of $P = (x, y)$ is $-P = (x, -y)$.

3. **Doubling a Point ($P = Q$):**
   - If $P = (x_1, y_1)$, the tangent slope is:
     $$
     m = \frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}
     $$
   - The new point $2P = (x', y')$ is:
     $$
     x' = m^2 - 2x_1, \quad y' = m(x_1 - x') - y_1
     $$

4. **Adding Two Points ($P \neq Q$):**
   - If $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$:
     $$
     m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
     $$
   - The result $R = (x_3, y_3)$ is:
     $$
     x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2, \quad y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1
     $$

5. **Vertical Line Case**:
   - If $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 \neq y_2$, the line is vertical, and the result is:
     $$
     P \oplus Q = O
     $$

### **Elliptic Curves: The Math Party’s MVP**
Why is this group law cool?
- It turns the curve into a **commutative group**, which means you can do secure cryptographic tricks like key exchanges and digital signatures.
- It’s visually intuitive (think about lines and tangents) but also has powerful algebra behind it.

---

### **Final Thought: Why Flipping is Fun**
The $x$-axis flipping rule ensures consistency. Without it, we wouldn’t have a well-behaved group, and the elliptic curve party would turn into chaos.
Here’s the extracted paragraph:


**Notation and Symbols:**

Let $F$ be a field and $E(F)$ an elliptic curve over $F$. We write $\oplus$ for the group law on $E(F)$, $(E(F), \oplus)$ for the commutative group of elliptic curve points, and use the additive notation (notation $4$) on this group. If $P$ is a point on a Short Weierstrass curve with $P = (x, 0)$, then $P$ is called **self-inverse**.

Let's break this down with a very detailed example, step by step, so it's crystal clear how elliptic curve point addition and doubling work in $E_{1,1}(F_5)$, the elliptic curve over the field $F_5$ with the equation:

$$y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 \ (\text{mod } 5) $$

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Curve**
The curve $E_{1,1}(F_5)$ has the following 9 elements:
$$
E_{1,1}(F_5) = \{ O, (0, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (0, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4) \}
$$
- $O$: The point at infinity, acting as the **neutral element**.
- Points like $(x, y)$ satisfy the curve equation $y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 \ (\text{mod } 5)$.

---

### **Step 2: Adding Two Points ($P \oplus Q$)**
Let’s compute $(0, 1) \oplus (4, 2)$ using the **chord rule**.

1. **The Formula**:
   For $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$:
   - Slope: $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \ (\text{mod } 5)$
   - Resulting point: $R = (x_3, y_3)$, where:
     $$
     x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2 \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$
     $$
     y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$

2. **Plug in the Points**:
   - $P = (0, 1)$, $Q = (4, 2)$.
   - Compute $m$:
     $$
     m = \frac{2 - 1}{4 - 0} \ (\text{mod } 5) = \frac{1}{4} \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$
     Since $4^{-1} \ (\text{mod } 5) = 4$ (the multiplicative inverse of 4 mod 5), we get:
     $$
     m = 1 \cdot 4 = 4 \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$

3. **Find $x_3$ and $y_3$**:
   - Compute $x_3$:
     $$
     x_3 = 4^2 - 0 - 4 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 16 - 4 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 2
     $$
   - Compute $y_3$:
     $$
     y_3 = 4(0 - 2) - 1 \ (\text{mod } 5) = -8 - 1 \ (\text{mod } 5) = -9 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 1
     $$

4. **Result**:
   $$
   (0, 1) \oplus (4, 2) = (2, 1)
   $$

---

### **Step 3: Doubling a Point ($P \oplus P$)**
Now, let’s double the point $(4, 2)$ using the **tangent rule**.

1. **The Formula**:
   For $P = (x_1, y_1)$, the tangent slope is:
   $$
   m = \frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1} \ (\text{mod } 5)
   $$
   Resulting point $R = (x', y')$:
   $$
   x' = m^2 - 2x_1 \ (\text{mod } 5)
   $$
   $$
   y' = m(x_1 - x') - y_1 \ (\text{mod } 5)
   $$

2. **Plug in the Point**:
   - $P = (4, 2)$, $a = 1$.
   - Compute $m$:
     $$
     m = \frac{3(4^2) + 1}{2(2)} \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$
     Simplify the numerator:
     $$
     3(16) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 4
     $$
     Compute $2(2) = 4 \ (\text{mod } 5)$. Thus:
     $$
     m = \frac{4}{4} \ (\text{mod } 5) = 1
     $$

3. **Find $x'$ and $y'$**:
   - Compute $x'$:
     $$
     x' = 1^2 - 2(4) \ (\text{mod } 5) = 1 - 8 \ (\text{mod } 5) = -7 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 3
     $$
   - Compute $y'$:
     $$
     y' = 1(4 - 3) - 2 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 1(1) - 2 \ (\text{mod } 5) = -1 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 4
     $$

4. **Result**:
   $$
   (4, 2) \oplus (4, 2) = (3, 4)
   $$

---

### **Final Results**
- $(0, 1) \oplus (4, 2) = (2, 1)$
- $(4, 2) \oplus (4, 2) = (3, 4)$

### **Scalar Multiplication: The Repeated Selfie Game**
Imagine you’re a photographer at an elliptic curve party. You want to create a photo series where every person (point $P$) multiplies themselves $m$-times in a mirror. The more they "multiply," the more fabulous and unique they look. This is **scalar multiplication**—adding the same point to itself over and over until you get a new, shiny result!

### **What’s Happening at the Party?**
1. **P Meets P**:
   - The first selfie is just $P$ hanging out alone. Easy peasy:
     $$   [1]P = P   $$
   - Now, $P$ decides to double itself. It pulls out a mirror (tangent line), finds a new reflection $2P$, and BOOM—fabulous upgrade.

2. **P Keeps Multiplying**:
   - Next, $P$ thinks, "Let’s triple this selfie magic." It partners with $2P$, grabs a chord, and finds a third reflection $3P$. 
   - Keep doing this, and $P$ keeps generating new, stylish points on the curve.

---

### **The Rulebook: How to Multiply Points**
**Scalar multiplication** is like a recipe for selfies:
1. Start with your base point $P$.
2. Double it, add it, repeat it. Math magic ensures you always land back on the curve (no awkward off-curve selfies allowed).
3. The result is a new point $[m]P$, where $m$ is the "selfie count."

---

### **How Does P Do It?**
#### **Case 1: Doubling (Tangent Rule)**
When $P$ doubles itself, it uses the **tangent line selfie hack**:
- The tangent line at $P$ touches the curve again at a point $R'$.
- Flip $R'$ across the x-axis to get $2P$, the new glam pose.

#### **Case 2: Adding (Chord Rule)**
When $P$ and another point $Q$ team up:
- Draw a line (chord) between them.
- This line intersects the curve at $R'$.
- Reflect $R'$ across the x-axis to get $P + Q$—the ultimate team-up selfie.

---

### **An Example: Meet Curve $E(F_5)$**
The elliptic curve is:
$$y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 \ (\text{mod } 5)$$
And the party guest list (points) is:
$$
E(F_5) = \{ O, (0, 1), (0, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3) \}
$$

Let’s have $P = (0, 1)$ start the selfie chain.

1. **Double the Fun ($2P$):**
   - Use the tangent rule:
     $$
     x' = \left( \frac{3x^2 + a}{2y} \right)^2 - 2x
     $$
     Substitute $x = 0$, $y = 1$, $a = 1$:
     $$
     m = \frac{3(0^2) + 1}{2(1)} = \frac{1}{2} \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$
     The inverse of $2 \ (\text{mod } 5)$ is $3$, so:
     $$
     m = 1 \cdot 3 = 3 \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$
     Now:
     $$
     x' = 3^2 - 2(0) = 9 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 4
     $$
     $$
     y' = m(x - x') - y = 3(0 - 4) - 1 = -13 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 2
     $$
     So, $2P = (4, 2)$.

2. **Triple the Drama ($3P$):**
   - Add $P = (0, 1)$ and $2P = (4, 2)$ using the chord rule:
     $$
     m = \frac{2 - 1}{4 - 0} = \frac{1}{4} \ (\text{mod } 5)
     $$
     The inverse of $4 \ (\text{mod } 5)$ is $4$, so:
     $$
     m = 1 \cdot 4 = 4
     $$
     Now:
     $$
     x' = 4^2 - 0 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 2
     $$
     $$
     y' = 4(0 - 2) - 1 = -8 - 1 = -9 \ (\text{mod } 5) = 1
     $$
     So, $3P = (2, 1)$.

---

### **Why Is Scalar Multiplication Cool?**
- It’s the **engine of elliptic curve cryptography**. Your private key is the scalar $m$, and your public key is $[m]P$.
- Multiplying is easy, but reversing the process (figuring out $m$ from $[m]P$) is like solving a Rubik’s cube in the dark—it’s nearly impossible without the key!

---

### **Party Trick: Infinite Multiplications**
After enough selfies, $P$ wraps back to $O$ (the point at infinity). This is the "end of the party" when the group order is reached. Every elliptic curve point eventually loops back like a cosmic boomerang.


So, scalar multiplication is not just math—it’s a **glamorous point dance on the elliptic curve dance floor**! 💃✨

### **5.12.Logarithmic Ordering: The Secret Codebook of Elliptic Curves**

Elliptic curves are like secret math clubs, and to unlock their secrets, you need a **decoder ring**—enter **logarithmic ordering**! It simplifies complicated elliptic curve operations and turns them into something as straightforward as basic arithmetic. Let’s dive into the fun of **logarithmic ordering** with a playful analogy.


### **What’s the Big Deal?**
Elliptic curves operate in a strange world where "adding points" isn’t your usual $x + y$ — it involves slopes, reflections, and modular arithmetic. This is great for cryptography but tough for pen-and-paper math warriors. **Logarithmic ordering** swoops in to save the day by organizing points into a **codebook** based on their relationship with a special generator point $g$.


### **The Codebook: Writing the Group in Style**
Imagine $g$ is the superstar generator point on the curve. Every other point can be written as a "multiple" of $g$, like this:
$$ G = \{ [1]g, [2]g, [3]g, \dots, [n-1]g, O \}$$
This is the **logarithmic order** of the group:
- $[1]g$: Just $g$, the generator itself.
- $[2]g$: Double the generator ($g + g$).
- $[3]g$: Triple the generator ($g + g + g$).
- $[n-1]g$: Almost full circle—$g$ multiplied $n-1$ times.

The point $O$, the **neutral element** (aka the "math nap spot"), comes last in the cycle because it’s like hitting the reset button.

---

### **Simplifying the Math: Addition Becomes Easy**
Let’s say you have two points $P$ and $Q$ on the curve. Instead of dealing with slopes and reflections, logarithmic ordering lets you handle them like simple numbers!

1. **Find the Codes**:
   - If $P = [l]g$, you know $P$’s position in the group (its "log").
   - If $Q = [m]g$, you know $Q$’s position.

2. **Add the Codes**:
   - Instead of fiddling with elliptic curve addition rules, just do modular addition:
     $$
     P \oplus Q = [l + m]g \quad (\text{mod } n)
     $$
   - Boom! Math made easy.

---

### **A Fun Analogy: The Elliptic Curve Subway**
Think of the elliptic curve as a subway line:
- The stations are the points $[1]g, [2]g, \dots, [n-1]g, O$.
- The generator $g$ is the starting station.
- Logarithmic ordering is like knowing exactly how many stops away you are from the start.

When you add $P$ and $Q$, you’re just figuring out how many stops their combined positions make. If you overshoot the last station ($n$), the subway loops back to the start (modular arithmetic magic)!

---

### **Why Does This Matter?**
1. **For Cryptography**:
   - The **elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP)** is the basis of elliptic curve security. Reversing the process (finding  $m$ from $[m]g$) is incredibly hard—this is why elliptic curves are so secure.

2. **For Simplicity**:
   - Logarithmic ordering helps reduce the headache of complex elliptic curve operations when working by hand or teaching the basics.

---

### **Key Takeaway**
Logarithmic ordering is like turning a complex recipe into a cheat sheet. By organizing the points on an elliptic curve in terms of a generator $g$, it makes addition as easy as combining numbers on a clock.

### **Example: Elliptic Curve Groups and Subgroups: The Hierarchy**
Elliptic curve groups like $E_{1,1}(F_5)$ are not just sets of points—they are structured communities with a well-defined hierarchy. Here, $E_{1,1}(F_5)$ has **order 9**, meaning it has 9 elements. These elements can form **subgroups** whose sizes are factors of 9 (1, 3, and 9). Let’s explore the subgroups and see them in action!

### **Step 1: The Subgroups of $E_{1,1}(F_5)$**
From the **Fundamental Theorem of Finite Cyclic Groups**, we know:
1. $E_{1,1}(F_5)[9]$: The whole group of order 9.
   - Contains all 9 elements: $\{O, (0,1), (4,2), (3,4), (2,1), \dots\}$.
2. $E_{1,1}(F_5)[3]$: A subgroup of order 3.
   - Contains 3 elements: $\{O, (2,1), (2,4)\}$.
   - Associated with the prime factor 3.
3. $E_{1,1}(F_5)[1]$: The trivial subgroup.
   - Contains just the point at infinity: $\{O\}$.

---

### **Step 2: Generators and Cycles**
Since $E_{1,1}(F_5)$ and its subgroups are cyclic, they each have **generators**:
- A generator is a point that, when repeatedly added to itself, cycles through all elements of the subgroup.
- For example:
  - $(2,1)$ is a generator of $E_{1,1}(F_5)[3]$, because:
    $$ [1](2,1) = (2,1), \quad [2](2,1) = (2,4), \quad [3](2,1) = O   $$

Let’s illustrate this with some examples!
### **Example 1: Understanding $E_{1,1}(F_5)[3]$**
The subgroup $E_{1,1}(F_5)[3]$ contains 3 elements: $\{O, (2,1), (2,4)\}$.

#### **Point Doubling and Tripling**
- Start with the generator $(2,1)$:
  - $[1](2,1) = (2,1)$ (just the point itself).
  - $[2](2,1) = (2,4)$:
    - Add $(2,1)$ to itself using the chord rule.
  - $[3](2,1) = O$ (the point at infinity):
    - Adding $(2,4)$ back to $(2,1)$ loops back to the neutral element $O$.

#### **Shortcut: Modular Arithmetic**
Using logarithmic ordering, this becomes as simple as:
- $1 + 1 = 2 \ (\text{mod } 3)$: $(2,1) + (2,1) = (2,4)$.
- $2 + 1 = 3 \ (\text{mod } 3) = 0$: $(2,4) + (2,1) = O$.

---

### **Example 2: Generating $E_{1,1}(F_5)[9]$**
The full group $E_{1,1}(F_5)$ has order 9 and includes all 9 points:
$$
E_{1,1}(F_5) = \{O, (0,1), (4,2), (3,4), (2,1), (3,1), (2,4), (4,3), (0,4)\}
$$

#### **Point Cycling with $(0,1)$**
Let’s repeatedly add $(0,1)$ to itself:
1. $[0](0,1) = O$ (neutral element).
2. $[1](0,1) = (0,1)$ (the generator itself).
3. $[2](0,1) = (4,2)$.
4. $[3](0,1) = (3,4)$.
5. $[4](0,1) = (2,1)$.
6. $[5](0,1) = (3,1)$.
7. $[6](0,1) = (2,4)$.
8. $[7](0,1) = (4,3)$.
9. $[8](0,1) = (0,4)$.
10. $[9](0,1) = O$ (looping back to the start).

---

### **Example 3: Using Logarithmic Ordering**
Logarithmic ordering simplifies operations:
- Instead of calculating $(0,1) + (4,2)$ with the chord rule, use:
  - $[1](0,1) + [2](0,1) = [3](0,1) = (3,4)$.

This avoids messy math and lets you "add points" like simple modular numbers!


### **Why This Matters**
1. **Cryptography**: Subgroups are essential for dividing work into manageable chunks.
2. **Math Fun**: Understanding subgroups helps uncover the symmetry and structure of elliptic curves.
3. **Efficiency**: Logarithmic ordering simplifies operations for small curves.

#### 5.1.Projective Short Weierstrass Form: Deep Dive

When working with elliptic curves, we usually describe points as pairs $(x, y)$ satisfying a certain equation. However, this description requires an extra "special point at infinity" to define a complete group structure. The **projective Short Weierstrass form** solves this elegantly by using projective geometry to naturally handle points at infinity.

Let’s break this concept down step by step.

### **Why Move to Projective Geometry?**
1. **Affine Representation Needs a Special Point**:
   - In affine geometry, we define elliptic curves as:
     $$  y^2 = x^3 + ax + b  $$
   - However, this form doesn’t include the **point at infinity**, which acts as the **neutral element** in the elliptic curve group. To make the group structure work, we must explicitly add this "special point."

2. **Projective Geometry Handles Infinity Naturally**:
   - Projective geometry extends affine geometry by adding "points at infinity" directly into the system. 
   - By moving to projective coordinates, we unify the point at infinity with the other points, making it a seamless part of the elliptic curve.

### **What Are Projective Coordinates?**
In projective geometry, a point $(x, y)$ in affine coordinates is represented as $[X : Y : Z]$ in projective coordinates, where:
- $[X : Y : Z]$ is a **homogeneous coordinate** system.
- The equivalence class $[X : Y : Z] = [kX : kY : kZ]$ for $k \neq 0$ ensures scale invariance.
- Points in the affine plane correspond to points where $Z \neq 0$, with:
  $$
  x = \frac{X}{Z}, \quad y = \frac{Y}{Z}
  $$
- The **point at infinity** corresponds to $Z = 0$.

---

### **Defining the Curve in Projective Coordinates**
The projective form of the Short Weierstrass curve is given by:
$$E(FP^2) = \{[X : Y : Z] \in FP^2 \ | \ Y^2Z = X^3 + aX Z^2 + b Z^3\}
$$

1. **What Does This Equation Mean?**
   - It’s a generalization of the affine curve equation $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$.
   - The terms $Z^2$ and $Z^3$ ensure the equation works even when $Z = 0$ (i.e., for points at infinity).

2. **Special Case: Points at Infinity**
   - Points at infinity occur when $Z = 0$. Substituting $Z = 0$ into the projective equation:
     $$
     Y^2 \cdot 0 = X^3 + aX \cdot 0^2 + b \cdot 0^3
     $$
     This simplifies to:
     $$
     0 = X^3
     $$
     Hence, $X = 0$, and the point at infinity is represented as:
     $$
     [0 : 1 : 0]
     $$

---

### **Unified Representation of the Point at Infinity**
- In affine coordinates, the point at infinity is treated as a separate entity, $O$
- In projective coordinates, the point at infinity is just another point:
  $$
  [0 : 1 : 0]
  $$
- This unification means we no longer need to handle the point at infinity as a special case—it’s seamlessly integrated into the curve.

---

### **Advantages of the Projective Form**
1. **No Special Point**:
   - The projective representation eliminates the need for an explicitly defined point at infinity in the affine form.

2. **Group Operations are Consistent**:
   - In projective geometry, the group law works uniformly for all points, including the point at infinity.

3. **Scale Invariance**:
   - The projective form ensures invariance under scaling, making it more robust for computations.

---

### **A Practical View: Why Use Projective Geometry?**
1. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - When implementing elliptic curves for cryptography, projective coordinates are often used to avoid divisions (which are computationally expensive). Instead of affine operations, where $x$ and $y$ are fractions, projective coordinates allow computations in terms of $X, Y, Z$.

2. **Geometric Elegance**:
   - By embedding the curve in projective space, the mathematics becomes cleaner and easier to generalize.

### **Key Takeaway**

The projective Short Weierstrass form is a powerful representation of elliptic curves that naturally incorporates the point at infinity. This eliminates the need for special handling of infinity in computations and provides a more uniform framework for working with elliptic curves in both theoretical and practical settings. 

### **Projective Group Law: Simplifying Operations in Projective Space**

Now we explore how the **group law** on elliptic curves operates in **projective coordinates**, with a focus on making things simpler and more uniform. By leveraging projective geometry, we eliminate some of the complexities present in affine space while still maintaining the core geometric rules like the **tangent-and-chord rule**.


### **Key Idea**
1. **Chord-and-Tangent Rule in Projective Space**:
   - In affine coordinates, adding two points $P$ and $Q$ or doubling a point $P$ requires careful handling of slopes and tangents.
   - In projective space, the group law works seamlessly because any chord will always intersect the curve at exactly three points, and any tangent will intersect it in exactly two points.

2. **Simplification**:
   - The **point at infinity**, which needed special handling in affine space, is now represented as $[0 : 1 : 0]$ in projective coordinates. This makes it an ordinary part of the curve.
   - The **additive inverse** of a point $[X : Y : Z]$ is simply $[X : -Y : Z]$. This geometric reflection is naturally handled in projective coordinates.


### **Group Structure in Projective Space**
The points of an elliptic curve in projective space form a **commutative group** under the tangent-and-chord rule. The following are key properties:

1. **Neutral Element**:
   - The point $[0 : 1 : 0]$ (representing the point at infinity) acts as the **neutral element**. Adding this point to any other point $[X : Y : Z]$ leaves the point unchanged:
     $$    [X : Y : Z] \oplus [0 : 1 : 0] = [X : Y : Z]     $$

2. **Additive Inverse**:
   - The additive inverse of a point $[X : Y : Z]$ is given by flipping the $Y$-coordinate:
     $$
     [X : Y : Z] \oplus [X : -Y : Z] = [0 : 1 : 0]
     $$

3. **Addition and Doubling**:
   - The addition or doubling of points is performed using specific algorithms that minimize the number of computations, described in algorithms like **Algorithm 7** (referenced here).

---

### **Worked Example (Exercise 68)**

Let’s compute the following operations step-by-step:

#### **Expression**:
Compute:
$$
[0 : 1 : 0] \oplus [4 : 3 : 1], \quad [0 : 3 : 0] \oplus [3 : 1 : 2], \quad -[0 : 4 : 1] \oplus [3 : 4 : 1]
$$
and:
$$
[4 : 3 : 1] \oplus [4 : 2 : 1]
$$

#### **Step 1: Add the Neutral Element**:
The point at infinity $[0 : 1 : 0]$ is the neutral element. So:
$$
[0 : 1 : 0] \oplus [4 : 3 : 1] = [4 : 3 : 1]
$$

#### **Step 2: Add Two Points ($[0 : 3 : 0] \oplus [3 : 1 : 2]$)**:
Here, the chord rule applies, and you compute the intersection of the line joining these two points with the curve equation. Use the projective addition formulas:
1. Calculate the slope $m$ (modular arithmetic is used).
2. Use the formulas for $X_3$, $Y_3$, and $Z_3$:
   $$   X_3 = (Y_2Z_1 - Y_1Z_2)^2 - X_1Z_2 - X_2Z_1
   $$
   $$
   Y_3 = m(X_1 - X_3) - Y_1
   $$
   $$
   Z_3 = Z_1Z_2
   $$

(Actual computation depends on the specific elliptic curve parameters, which aren't explicitly provided here.)

#### **Step 3: Additive Inverse**:
The inverse of $[0 : 4 : 1]$ is $[0 : -4 : 1]$ (which simplifies under modular arithmetic).


### **Why Use Projective Coordinates?**
1. **Unified Representation**:
   - The point at infinity is naturally integrated into the system.
   - No need for special-case handling.

2. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Projective coordinates eliminate divisions, which are computationally expensive.
   - Operations like point addition and doubling become faster and more reliable.

3. **Geometric Simplicity**:
   - The geometry of the curve in projective space ensures that all lines and tangents interact with the curve in predictable ways.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- The **projective group law** makes elliptic curve operations uniform, efficient, and well-suited for both theory and computation.
- Adding points in projective space follows the same geometric intuition as affine space but avoids the pitfalls of dealing with special points like the point at infinity.

2. **Projective Representation**: Powerful and efficient, particularly for cryptographic applications where avoiding divisions and computational efficiency are critical.
:::info
The **projective form** of elliptic curves plays a critical role in cryptographic applications due to its computational efficiency and ability to handle edge cases seamlessly. Here are some key cryptographic applications:

---

### **1. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**
- **Use Case**: Key exchange, digital signatures, and public-key encryption.
- **Why Projective Form?**
  - ECC relies heavily on scalar multiplication ($[k]P$, repeated point addition and doubling). The projective form eliminates divisions (fractions), which are computationally expensive in finite fields, making ECC faster and more efficient.
  - The neutral element $ O $ (point at infinity) is naturally included in computations, ensuring a uniform and robust implementation.
- **Examples**:
  - Algorithms like ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) and ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) benefit from projective coordinates for performance optimization.

---

### **2. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (e.g., zk-SNARKs)**
- **Use Case**: Proving the validity of a statement without revealing the statement itself.
- **Why Projective Form?**
  - zk-SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) often rely on pairing-friendly elliptic curves.
  - Projective coordinates reduce the computational overhead of operations like pairings, scalar multiplications, and additions on elliptic curves.
  - By minimizing the number of field divisions, projective coordinates accelerate the proof generation process.
- **Examples**:
  - Curves like **BLS12-381** (used in zk-SNARK systems like Zcash) leverage projective forms for efficient pairing-based operations.

---

### **3. Pairing-Based Cryptography**
- **Use Case**: Identity-based encryption (IBE), attribute-based encryption (ABE), and short signatures.
- **Why Projective Form?**
  - Pairing operations, such as the Tate or Weil pairing, involve multiple elliptic curve operations, including point additions, doublings, and multiplications.
  - Projective coordinates ensure that these operations are carried out efficiently, especially in pairing-friendly curves like **BN254** and **BLS12-381**.
- **Examples**:
  - Identity-based encryption schemes (e.g., Boneh-Franklin IBE).
  - Signature schemes like BLS signatures.

---

### **4. Post-Quantum Cryptography**
- **Use Case**: Designing cryptographic systems resilient to quantum attacks.
- **Why Projective Form?**
  - While elliptic curve cryptography itself is not post-quantum secure (vulnerable to Shor's algorithm), certain hybrid systems like isogeny-based cryptography (e.g., SIDH/SIKE) utilize elliptic curve operations in projective form to optimize performance.
  - Projective coordinates streamline calculations in isogeny walks, which involve traversing graphs of elliptic curves.

---

### **5. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency**
- **Use Case**: Secure digital transactions, smart contracts, and decentralized systems.
- **Why Projective Form?**
  - Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (using secp256k1) and Ethereum (using alt_bn128) rely on elliptic curve cryptography for digital signatures and zk-SNARKs.
  - Projective coordinates improve the efficiency of point addition and scalar multiplication in key generation and transaction signing.
- **Examples**:
  - Ethereum’s use of alt_bn128 for zk-SNARK verification.
  - Bitcoin’s use of secp256k1 for ECDSA signatures.

---

### **6. Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC)**
- **Use Case**: Securely performing computations on encrypted data without revealing the data.
- **Why Projective Form?**
  - Many MPC protocols use elliptic curves for distributed key generation and threshold signatures.
  - Projective coordinates improve the efficiency of these protocols by reducing computational overhead.

---

### **7. Hardware Acceleration**
- **Use Case**: Cryptographic operations on embedded systems and hardware devices.
- **Why Projective Form?**
  - Devices with limited computational resources (e.g., smartcards, IoT devices) benefit from projective coordinates due to their elimination of costly division operations.
  - The streamlined implementation in projective coordinates fits well into hardware optimization frameworks like FPGA and ASIC.

---

### **Advantages of Projective Form in Cryptography**
1. **Elimination of Divisions**:
   - Divisions in finite fields are computationally expensive. Projective coordinates replace divisions with multiplications, significantly improving performance.
2. **Unified Handling of Point at Infinity**:
   - No need for special cases in computations; the point at infinity is just another point in the system.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Projective coordinates scale well with large finite fields and high-security curves, essential for modern cryptographic needs.
4. **Robustness**:
   - Avoids computational errors that might arise from affine division operations, particularly in hardware implementations.

Its efficiency in elliptic curve operations makes it indispensable for high-performance cryptography, whether in zero-knowledge proofs, blockchain systems, or hardware-accelerated encryption.

### **Affine to Projective Transformations and Back: The Bridge Between Representations**

Elliptic curves can be represented in **affine coordinates** or **projective coordinates**, depending on the needs of the application. The transformation between these two representations ensures that the mathematical equivalence of elliptic curves is preserved while taking advantage of the computational benefits of each form.

---

### **Affine to Projective Transformation**
The transformation from the affine representation $E(F)$ to the projective representation $E(FP^2)$ maps affine points $(x, y)$ into homogeneous coordinates $[X : Y : Z]$:
$$I : E(F) \to E(FP^2)$$
Defined as:
$$
(x, y) \mapsto [x : y : 1]
$$
- The affine point $(x, y)$ becomes $[x : y : 1]$.
- The neutral element (point at infinity) in the affine representation, $O$, becomes:
  $$
  O \mapsto [0 : 1 : 0]
  $$

**Key Properties:**
1. **1-to-1 Correspondence**: Each point in the affine representation corresponds to exactly one point in the projective representation.
2. **Group Structure Preserved**: This map respects the group law, meaning that the sum of two points in affine space corresponds to the sum of their transformed counterparts in projective space.

---

### **Projective to Affine Transformation**
The reverse transformation maps points in projective space back to affine space:
$$
I^{-1} : E(FP^2) \to E(F)
$$
Defined as:
$$
[X : Y : Z] \mapsto \left(\frac{X}{Z}, \frac{Y}{Z}\right), \quad \text{if } Z \neq 0
$$
- For points with $Z \neq 0$, this recovers the original affine point.
- For the point at infinity $[0 : 1 : 0]$, the transformation is:
  $$
  [0 : 1 : 0] \mapsto O
  $$

**Key Properties:**
1. **1-to-1 Correspondence**: The transformation maps each projective point back to its unique affine counterpart.
2. **Handles $Z = 0$**: The point at infinity is automatically handled during this transformation.

---

### **Equivalence and Group Isomorphism**
The transformations $I$ and $I^{-1}$ form a **group isomorphism**, meaning:
- The affine and projective forms represent the same mathematical structure but in two different views.
- This equivalence ensures that computations and properties of elliptic curves remain consistent across representations.

---

### **Why These Transformations Matter**
1. **Unifying Representations**:
   - The affine and projective forms are two perspectives on the same mathematical object. These transformations bridge the gap between them.
2. **Cryptographic Efficiency**:
   - Computations in cryptography often start with inputs in affine form (e.g., public keys) but use projective form for internal efficiency.
   - After computations, results are transformed back to affine form for output (e.g., signatures, encrypted data).

---

### **Algorithm 7: Projective Short Weierstrass Addition Law**
This algorithm provides a practical method for adding points in the projective representation:
1. **Inputs**: Two points $[X_1 : Y_1 : Z_1]$ and $[X_2 : Y_2 : Z_2]$ in projective space.
2. **Output**: The sum of these points $[X_3 : Y_3 : Z_3]$ in projective space.

The algorithm:
- Handles special cases like the neutral element ($[0 : 1 : 0]$).
- Avoids divisions by working entirely in projective space.
- Uses modular arithmetic and field operations to compute the result efficiently.

---

### **Takeaways**
1. **Affine vs. Projective**:
   - Affine representation is intuitive but computationally expensive due to divisions.
   - Projective representation is efficient and eliminates divisions.

2. **Seamless Transition**:
   - Transformations $I$ and $I^{-1}$ allow seamless switching between affine and projective forms, preserving group properties and ensuring consistency.

3. **Cryptographic Relevance**:
   - Most cryptographic algorithms perform calculations in projective coordinates and present results in affine form.

By leveraging these transformations, we unlock the computational power of projective coordinates while retaining the interpretability of affine coordinates.

#### Montgomery

### **Montgomery Curves: A Specialized Representation**

Elliptic curves can often be expressed in different forms to optimize specific computations. One of these forms is the **Montgomery form**, a specialized representation that simplifies certain operations, especially **scalar multiplication**. Montgomery curves are particularly valuable in cryptography due to their efficiency and unique properties.

---

### **What is a Montgomery Curve?**
A **Montgomery curve** is a subset of elliptic curves, defined over a finite field $F$, that satisfies the **Montgomery cubic equation**:
$$
B \cdot y^2 = x^3 + A \cdot x^2 + x,
$$
where $A, B \in F$, $B \neq 0$, and $A^2 - 4 \neq 0 \mod p$. 

The set of points on the curve, denoted $M(F)$, is:
$$
M(F) = \{(x, y) \in F \times F \mid B \cdot y^2 = x^3 + A \cdot x^2 + x\} \cup \{O\},
$$
where $O$ represents the **point at infinity**, which acts as the neutral element.

---

### **Why Use Montgomery Curves?**
Montgomery curves are not just another way to describe elliptic curves—they come with **practical advantages**:
1. **Efficient Scalar Multiplication**: Montgomery curves allow **constant-time scalar multiplication** algorithms, which are faster than traditional approaches for generic elliptic curves.
2. **Specialized Use in Cryptography**: Algorithms like the **Montgomery ladder** benefit from this representation, making them resistant to certain side-channel attacks.
3. **Conversion Flexibility**: Montgomery curves can often be transformed into the more general **Short Weierstrass form**, and vice versa, enabling flexibility in cryptographic protocols.

---

### **Relation to Short Weierstrass Form**
Any Montgomery curve can be **transformed** into a Short Weierstrass curve using the following substitution:
$$
B \cdot y^2 = x^3 + A \cdot x^2 + x \quad \implies \quad y^2 = x^3 + \frac{3 - A^2}{3 \cdot B^2} \cdot x + \frac{2 \cdot A^3 - 9 \cdot A}{27 \cdot B^3}.
$$

This ensures compatibility with general elliptic curve properties and allows cryptographers to switch between forms when necessary.

---

### **Conditions for a Montgomery Curve**
Not every elliptic curve can be expressed in Montgomery form. The following **conditions** must hold for a Short Weierstrass curve to be convertible into a Montgomery curve:
1. The number of points on the curve $E(F)$ is divisible by 4.
2. The polynomial $z^3 + az + b \in F[z]$ has at least one root $z_0 \in F$.
3. The value $3z_0^2 + a$ must be a **quadratic residue** in $F^*$.

If these conditions are satisfied, the curve can be rewritten in Montgomery form:

$$s \cdot y^2 = x^3 + (3z_0s)x^2 + x,$$
where $s = ( \sqrt{3z_0^2 + a})^{-1}$.



### **Tiny-Jubjub Curve as a Montgomery Curve**
The section introduces an example where the **Tiny-Jubjub curve**, previously discussed in its Short Weierstrass form, is shown to also fit the Montgomery curve criteria. This demonstrates the flexibility of elliptic curve representations and their equivalence under proper transformations.

---

### **Cryptographic Relevance of Montgomery Curves**
1. **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)**:
   - Montgomery curves are widely used in key exchange protocols, such as **Curve25519**, which is implemented in modern secure communication systems like Signal and WhatsApp.
2. **Efficient Ladder Algorithms**:
   - The **Montgomery ladder** allows secure and constant-time scalar multiplication, a critical operation in cryptographic schemes.
3. **Side-Channel Resistance**:
   - Montgomery form reduces vulnerability to timing attacks by making operations constant-time.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- Montgomery curves are a special representation of elliptic curves designed for efficient computation, especially scalar multiplication.
- Their transformation compatibility with Short Weierstrass form allows cryptographers to use them interchangeably depending on the task.
- They are indispensable in modern cryptography, powering secure protocols in everything from messaging apps to blockchain systems.


### **Affine Montgomery Coordinate Transformation**

In this section, we examine the mathematical link between the **Montgomery form** and the **Short Weierstrass form** of elliptic curves. It turns out these two representations are mathematically equivalent, and points in one form can be mapped to the other through a 1-to-1 correspondence (an **isomorphism**).

---

### **Mapping Montgomery to Short Weierstrass**
Given a Montgomery curve $M_{A,B}$ (defined by $B \cdot y^2 = x^3 + A \cdot x^2 + x$) and a Short Weierstrass curve $E_{a,b}$ (defined by $y^2 = x^3 + a \cdot x + b$), we can map points between these forms.

#### **Forward Map ($I$)**
The function $I$ maps points from the Montgomery form to the Short Weierstrass form as follows:
$$
I : M_{A,B} \to E_{a,b} : (x, y) \mapsto \left( \frac{3x + A}{3B}, \frac{y}{B} \right)
$$
- The affine coordinates \((x, y)\) on the Montgomery curve are transformed into \((x', y')\) on the Short Weierstrass curve using these formulas.
- **Point at Infinity**: The point at infinity on the Montgomery curve is mapped directly to the point at infinity on the Short Weierstrass curve.

#### **Parameters Transformation**
The parameters of the Montgomery curve \((A, B)\) are transformed into those of the Short Weierstrass curve \((a, b)\):
$$
a = \frac{3 - A^2}{3B^2}, \quad b = \frac{2A^3 - 9A}{27B^3}
$$

---

### **Mapping Short Weierstrass to Montgomery**
The reverse function $I^{-1}$ maps points back from the Short Weierstrass form to the Montgomery form:
$$
I^{-1} : E_{a,b} \to M_{A,B} : (x, y) \mapsto \left( s \cdot (x - z_0), s \cdot y \right)
$$
- $s = (\sqrt{3z_0^2 + a})^{-1}$, where $z_0$ is a root of the polynomial $z^3 + az + b$.
- **Point at Infinity**: The point at infinity on the Short Weierstrass curve is mapped directly to the point at infinity on the Montgomery curve.

---

### **Why Is This Useful?**
1. **Flexibility**:
   - Cryptographers can freely switch between the Montgomery and Short Weierstrass forms, depending on the application or desired efficiency.
2. **Algorithm Optimization**:
   - Montgomery curves are often used for scalar multiplication due to their computational efficiency, while Short Weierstrass curves are more commonly used in theoretical formulations.
3. **Group Structure Preservation**:
   - The transformations $I$ and $I^{-1}$ respect the group law, ensuring that the addition of points in one form corresponds to the addition of their transformed counterparts in the other form.

---

### **Key Takeaway**
These transformations demonstrate the mathematical equivalence of Montgomery and Short Weierstrass forms. By switching representations using $I$ and $I^{-1}$, cryptographers and mathematicians can take advantage of the unique benefits of each form without losing any structural properties.

-----------------------------------


### **Montgomery Group Law: The Backbone of Operations**

Montgomery curves inherit the group structure of elliptic curves, allowing mathematical operations like addition and scalar multiplication to be well-defined. This section outlines the **group law** for Montgomery curves, which dictates how points on the curve interact with each other. Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### **Key Elements of the Montgomery Group Law**
1. **Neutral Element**:
   - The point at infinity, denoted as $O$, serves as the **neutral element** in this group.
   - For any point $P$ on the curve, $P \oplus O = P$.

2. **Inverse Element**:
   - For any point $P = (x, y)$, the inverse point is $-P = (x, -y)$.
   - Adding $P$ and $-P$ yields the point at infinity: $P \oplus (-P) = O$.

3. **Group Law for Addition**:
   - The group law depends on the specific relationship between the points being added. Let’s consider the cases:

---

### **Cases for Addition**
#### **Case 1: Adding the Neutral Element**
If $Q = O$, then $P \oplus Q = P$. This follows directly from the definition of $O$ as the neutral element.

---

#### **Case 2: Adding Inverse Elements**
If $P = (x, y)$ and $Q = (x, -y)$, then $P \oplus Q = O$. This cancels the points and results in the neutral element.

---

#### **Case 3: Doubling a Point (Tangent Rule)**
When you double a point $P = (x, y)$, the tangent rule applies. The coordinates of the resulting point $R = P \oplus P$ are:
$$
x' = \left(\frac{3x^2 + 2Ax + 1}{2By}\right)^2 \cdot B - 2x - A,
$$
$$
y' = \frac{3x^2 + 2Ax + 1}{2By} \cdot (x - x') - y.
$$
This uses the tangent to the curve at $P$ to determine the new point.

---

#### **Case 4: Adding Two Distinct Points (Chord Rule)**
If $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$, where $x_1 \neq x_2$, the chord rule applies. The coordinates of the resulting point $R = P \oplus Q$ are:
$$
x' = \left(\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\right)^2 \cdot B - (x_1 + x_2) - A,
$$
$$
y' = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \cdot (x_1 - x') - y_1.
$$
This uses the line (chord) connecting $P$ and $Q$ to find the intersection point with the curve.

---

### **Why Is This Important?**
The Montgomery group law is the foundation of operations in cryptography. By defining these rules:
- We can perform **scalar multiplication**, which is essential for cryptographic tasks like key exchange and digital signatures.
- The simplicity of these formulas allows for efficient computation, especially when paired with optimizations like the Montgomery ladder.

---

### **Practical Applications**
1. **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)**:
   - The Montgomery group law is used in efficient computation of shared secrets in protocols like Curve25519.
2. **Signature Schemes**:
   - Algorithms like EdDSA use points on Montgomery curves for signing and verification.
3. **Efficient Computation**:
   - The group law is optimized for cryptographic hardware and software implementations, reducing the computational overhead.

---

### **Summary**
The Montgomery group law defines how points interact on the curve:
- It handles edge cases (e.g., neutral elements and inverses).
- It provides mathematical rules for adding and doubling points.
- It powers efficient and secure cryptographic operations.


### **Twisted Edwards Curves: A SNARK-Friendly Alternative**

---

Twisted Edwards curves are a fascinating and practical alternative to traditional elliptic curve representations, especially in contexts like **SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge)**. Their simplicity and efficiency make them highly desirable for cryptographic applications.

---

### **What Are Twisted Edwards Curves?**

A **Twisted Edwards Curve** is defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ with a characteristic greater than 3. The equation takes the following form:

$$
a \cdot x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d \cdot x^2 \cdot y^2
$$

Here:
- $a$ and $d$ are non-zero elements in $\mathbb{F}$.
- $a \neq d$ ensures the curve remains non-singular.
- Special property for **SNARK-friendliness**:
  - $a$ must be a **quadratic residue**, and $d$ must be a **quadratic non-residue**.

---

### **Key Advantages**
1. **Simplified Group Laws**:
   - Unlike the **Short Weierstrass** or **Montgomery** curves, the group law for Twisted Edwards curves is uniform and requires no branching logic for different cases. This makes them highly efficient for computation.
2. **Compact Representation**:
   - Twisted Edwards curves avoid the need for a dedicated "point at infinity," as $(0, 1)$ serves that purpose inherently.
3. **Cryptographic Applications**:
   - Due to their efficiency and SNARK-friendliness, Twisted Edwards curves are widely used in **zk-SNARKs** and other privacy-preserving cryptographic protocols.

---

### **Equivalence to Montgomery Curves**

Interestingly, every Twisted Edwards curve can be transformed into an equivalent **Montgomery curve**, and vice versa. Let’s break this equivalence down:

1. **From Twisted Edwards to Montgomery**:
   - If a curve is defined by the Twisted Edwards equation, the associated Montgomery curve takes the form:
     $$
     \frac{4}{a - d} \cdot y^2 = x^3 + \frac{2(a + d)}{a - d} \cdot x^2 + x
     $$
   - This transformation ensures that the same mathematical structure is preserved.

2. **From Montgomery to Twisted Edwards**:
   - Given a Montgomery curve $B y^2 = x^3 + A x^2 + x$, it can be transformed into a Twisted Edwards curve:
     $$
     \left( \frac{A + 2}{B} \right)x^2 + y^2 = 1 + \left( \frac{A - 2}{B} \right)x^2y^2
     $$

---

### **Cryptographic Applications**

1. **SNARKs and zk-SNARKs**:
   - The uniform group law and fewer required operations make Twisted Edwards curves particularly well-suited for efficient implementation in zk-SNARKs.

2. **Digital Signatures**:
   - Twisted Edwards curves are the backbone of many efficient signature schemes, such as **Ed25519**, which is widely used in secure communications (e.g., SSH, TLS).

3. **Privacy Protocols**:
   - Their efficiency and uniformity make them ideal for privacy-preserving cryptographic systems like **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**.

---

### **Why Are They SNARK-Friendly?**

In a SNARK context, computational branching (if-else conditions) can lead to inefficiencies and potential vulnerabilities. Twisted Edwards curves eliminate this issue:
- Their group law applies universally without exceptions.
- This reduces computational overhead and simplifies implementations.

---

Twisted Edwards curves represent a leap forward in elliptic curve design, combining mathematical elegance with cryptographic practicalit

#### Examples

This example demonstrates how the Tiny-jubjub curve, initially presented in a Montgomery form, can be rewritten in its Twisted Edwards form and verified as "SNARK-friendly." Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Identifying Montgomery Parameters
From previous examples, we know that the Tiny-jubjub curve in its Montgomery form has parameters \(A = 6\) and \(B = 7\). Using the transformation equations for converting Montgomery curves to Twisted Edwards curves, the parameters \(a\) and \(d\) for the Twisted Edwards form are computed as:

1. **Compute \(a\):**
   $$
   a = \frac{A + 2}{B} = \frac{6 + 2}{7} = \frac{8}{7} = 3 \quad \text{(mod 13, since \(7^{-1} = 2\))}.
   $$

2. **Compute \(d\):**
   $$
   d = \frac{A - 2}{B} = \frac{6 - 2}{7} = \frac{4}{7} = 8 \quad \text{(mod 13)}.
   $$

Thus, the defining parameters for the Twisted Edwards form are \(a = 3\) and \(d = 8\).

---

### Step 2: Check SNARK-Friendliness
For a Twisted Edwards curve to be SNARK-friendly, the parameter \(a\) must be a quadratic residue in \(F_{13}\), and \(d\) must be a quadratic non-residue. Using Euler's criterion, these properties are verified:

1. **For \(a = 3\):**
   $$
   \left( \frac{3}{13} \right) = 3^{\frac{13-1}{2}} = 3^6 = 1 \quad \text{(mod 13)}.
   $$
   Since the result is \(1\), \(a = 3\) is a quadratic residue.

2. **For \(d = 8\):**
   $$
   \left( \frac{8}{13} \right) = 8^{\frac{13-1}{2}} = 8^6 = -1 \quad \text{(mod 13)}.
   $$
   Since the result is \(-1\), \(d = 8\) is a quadratic non-residue.

Thus, the Tiny-jubjub curve is confirmed to be SNARK-friendly.

---

### Step 3: Twisted Edwards Form of the Curve
The curve is written in its Twisted Edwards form as:
$$
TE_{TJJ\_13} = \{ (x, y) \in F_{13} \times F_{13} \mid 3 \cdot x^2 + y^2 = 1 + 8 \cdot x^2 \cdot y^2 \}.
$$

---

### Step 4: Computing Curve Points
By inserting all possible pairs \((x, y) \in F_{13} \times F_{13}\) into the equation, we compute the set of points that satisfy the curve equation. This produces the following set:
$$
TE_{TJJ\_13} = \{(0, 1), (0, 12), (1, 2), (1, 11), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 0), (5, 5), (5, 8), \dots \}.
$$

---

### Step 5: Verification
The result is double-checked using Sage, confirming that the points computed in the Twisted Edwards form align with those in the Short Weierstrass or Edwards representation.

---

### Key Takeaways
- This example showcases the equivalence between Montgomery and Twisted Edwards curves.
- The transformation equations provide a way to convert between representations while preserving the mathematical properties of the curve.
- Verifying SNARK-friendliness ensures the curve is efficient for cryptographic applications like zk-SNARKs.

The **Twisted Edwards group law** describes how to add two points on a Twisted Edwards curve using a single computational formula. Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### **Key Features of the Group Law**
1. **Simplified Computation**: Unlike Short Weierstrass or Montgomery curves, the Twisted Edwards group law works uniformly for all cases, including adding points, doubling points, or involving the neutral element.
   
2. **Neutral Element**: The point \((0, 1)\) acts as the neutral element. This means that:
   $$
   (x, y) \oplus (0, 1) = (x, y).
   $$

3. **Inverses**: The inverse of a point \((x, y)\) is \((-x, y)\). This property makes computation with inverses straightforward.

---

### **Addition Formula**
For two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) on a Twisted Edwards curve \(E(F)\), their sum is given by the formula:
$$
(x_1, y_1) \oplus (x_2, y_2) = \left( \frac{x_1y_2 + y_1x_2}{1 + dx_1x_2y_1y_2}, \frac{y_1y_2 - ax_1x_2}{1 - dx_1x_2y_1y_2} \right),
$$
where \(a\) and \(d\) are the parameters defining the Twisted Edwards curve equation:
$$
a \cdot x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d \cdot x^2y^2.
$$

---

### **How it Works**
1. **Numerators**:
   - The new \(x'\)-coordinate involves both the products of \(x_1y_2\) and \(y_1x_2\).
   - The new \(y'\)-coordinate involves \(y_1y_2\) (for the second \(y\)-coordinate) and \(-ax_1x_2\).

2. **Denominators**:
   - The denominator ensures that the addition law adheres to the curve equation. It depends on the products of \(x_1x_2y_1y_2\) scaled by \(d\), the curve parameter.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - Adding the neutral element \((0, 1)\) leaves the point unchanged.
   - Adding a point to its inverse results in the neutral element:
     $$
     (x_1, y_1) \oplus (-x_1, y_1) = (0, 1).
     $$

---

### **Why Is This Important?**
- The **Twisted Edwards group law** is incredibly efficient and avoids branching (special cases) in programming implementations, making it particularly useful in cryptographic contexts like zk-SNARKs.
- It unifies all cases of point addition into a single formula, simplifying both theoretical analysis and practical coding.

---

This formula encapsulates the beauty and utility of Twisted Edwards curves in cryptography, emphasizing their role in secure and efficient computation.

This example illustrates how to apply the **Twisted Edwards group law** on the Tiny-jubjub curve in its Edwards form (as defined in Equation 5.36). Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### **Curve Recap**
The curve is given as:
$$
TE\_TJJ\_13 = \{ (0, 1), (0, 12), (1, 2), (1, 11), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 0), (5, 5), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 5), (8, 8), (10, 0), (11, 6), (11, 7), (12, 2), (12, 11) \}.
$$
We will compute the results of various group operations using the group law for Twisted Edwards curves (Equation 5.38):
$$
(x_1, y_1) \oplus (x_2, y_2) = \left( \frac{x_1y_2 + y_1x_2}{1 + dx_1x_2y_1y_2}, \frac{y_1y_2 - ax_1x_2}{1 - dx_1x_2y_1y_2} \right),
$$
where \(a = 3\), \(d = 8\) (parameters of the Tiny-jubjub curve).

---

### **Neutral Element Addition**
#### Step 1: Adding \((0, 1)\) to itself
We apply the group law:
$$
(0, 1) \oplus (0, 1) = \left( \frac{0 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0}{1 + 8 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 1}, \frac{1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot 0 \cdot 0}{1 - 8 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 1} \right).
$$
Simplifying:
$$
(0, 1) \oplus (0, 1) = \left( 0, 1 \right).
$$
This confirms that \((0, 1)\) is indeed the **neutral element**.

---

#### Step 2: Adding the neutral element to another point, \((8, 5)\)
Using the group law:
$$
(0, 1) \oplus (8, 5) = \left( \frac{0 \cdot 5 + 1 \cdot 8}{1 + 8 \cdot 0 \cdot 8 \cdot 5}, \frac{1 \cdot 5 - 3 \cdot 0 \cdot 8}{1 - 8 \cdot 0 \cdot 8 \cdot 5} \right).
$$
Simplifying:
$$
(0, 1) \oplus (8, 5) = (8, 5).
$$
This shows that adding the neutral element to any point leaves the point unchanged.

---

### **Inverse Check**
To confirm the inverse property, we compute the result of adding a point to its inverse. For example, consider \((5, 5)\) and its inverse \((-5, 5)\).

Using the group law:
$$
(5, 5) \oplus (5, 5) = \left( \frac{5 \cdot 5 + 5 \cdot 5}{1 + 8 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}, \frac{5 \cdot 5 - 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}{1 - 8 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5} \right).
$$
Simplify numerators and denominators modulo 13:
$$
x' = \frac{25 + 25}{1 + 100} = \frac{50}{101} \equiv \frac{12}{9}.
$$
Further simplifying:
$$
\left(0, 1\right).
$$
This confirms correctness.
